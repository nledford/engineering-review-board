# Engineering Agent Governance

Use this guide to choose the correct runtime role, command, and handoff when
maintaining the repository's OpenCode definitions. The agent and command files
remain authoritative; this page is a source map and does not grant permissions
or extend a Task allowlist. [`opencode/manifest.json`](../opencode/manifest.json)
lists the tracked definitions.

## Keep Runtime Concepts Separate

| Concept | Purpose | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill | Reusable procedure loaded by an agent for a task. | A skill name is not a runtime agent ID and grants no edit, delegation, review, or plan/state authority. |
| Agent | Runtime role defined under [`opencode/agents/`](../opencode/agents/). | Its `mode`, permission map, exact registered ID, and the runtime Task allowlist control what it can do. Never derive an ID from a skill name or job title. |
| Command | Top-level entry point defined under [`opencode/commands/`](../opencode/commands/). | Its `agent` field selects a primary agent. A command routes work but does not add authority to that agent. |

Primary-agent authority is turn-scoped, not conversation-scoped. Authority
follows the primary agent selected for the current user turn; earlier assistant
turns remain attributed context and do not transfer identity or permissions.
"Top-level" means selected as a primary agent rather than invoked through Task,
so it does not require a fresh conversation. A human may obtain ERB advice,
select the Engineering Lead in the same conversation, and explicitly request
implementation under the Lead contract. Use a fresh conversation when formal
contextual independence matters.

For this explicit ERB-to-Lead implementation handoff, `/address-review` selects
the Engineering Lead for the current command turn and identifies prior Board
output as read-only advisory context from a different primary agent. The
command does not widen Lead authority: it requires fresh repository evidence
and re-evaluation, and routes durable plan creation or existing-plan execution
through the human-controlled Plan Orchestrator commands.

## Roles and Limits

| Role | Owns | Must not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Engineering Lead](../opencode/agents/engineering-lead.md) | Request intake, process selection, direct or bounded unplanned delivery, integration, validation, and independent-review handoff. | Invoke the ERB as a Task child, claim a Board decision without its output, or write or execute a durable plan or trusted planned-work state. |
| [Engineering Review Board](../opencode/agents/engineering-review-board.md) | Optional independent read-only advice, specialist selection, evidence synthesis, and severity assessment. Invoke it as a separate primary agent. | Edit the repository, implement a fix, change plans or state, or control plan creation, updates, execution, or persistence. |
| [Plan Orchestrator](../opencode/agents/plan-orchestrator.md) | Top-level read-only consultation, safe closed lean-plan creation, trusted planned-work state, planned execution, integration, validation, and native planned-work TODOs. | Act as a Task child, mutate a created plan beyond evidenced existing checkboxes, delegate to anything other than the Worker, or claim ERB advisory evidence controls planned work. |
| [Implementation Worker](../opencode/agents/implementation-worker.md) | One bounded implementation unit assigned by the Lead or Plan Orchestrator, plus focused validation and an evidence report. It is the only implementation subagent. | Edit durable plans; read or mutate `.start-work/**`; invoke the trusted planned-work helper; delegate; stage; commit; push; deploy; broaden scope; or perform destructive migrations. |
| Review and research specialists | Bounded, decision-relevant analysis for the Lead or ERB using exact runtime-visible IDs. | Implement changes, simulate the ERB, approve plans, or treat advisory output as final authority. |

For audit-only work on code comments, docstrings, embedded API documentation,
examples, or documentation tests, the Lead or ERB may assign exact source scope
to `documentation-critic`. A code-only assignment treats standalone Markdown as
source-of-truth evidence, not as a review or edit target. The critic remains
read-only and names observed or unrun repository-native documentation checks.
When the human requests corrections, the Lead implements them directly or uses
one bounded `implementation-worker` unit and runs the applicable language or
documentation validation. Skills provide procedure and never transfer that
authority to the critic.

The Lead may directly implement complex work when scope, safety, and validation
are adequate, and retains its MCP, clipboard, Git, and transient unplanned-TODO
authority. Complexity may justify a planning recommendation but never creates a
plan or invokes `/start-work` automatically. The Lead or ERB may recommend
top-level `/consult-plan` for separate read-only Plan Orchestrator advice, with a
reason, trade-off, and proposed scope. It is not Task delegation and cannot
create, mutate, authorize, or execute work. The human's decision to require,
decline, or override planning advice controls the route. When the Lead delegates implementation, it uses only
`implementation-worker`. Durable plan or `.start-work` mutations route through a
top-level Plan Orchestrator command, never a Task child. The ERB and its
specialists stay on the advisory side of that boundary.

A current conversational split-or-replace request to the top-level Plan
Orchestrator is explicit plan-only authority to create at least two successors
and retire one unambiguous source after guarded registration. Earlier review or
consultation advice alone is not authority. The source must be registered,
unchanged, unchecked, and inactive. The Plan Orchestrator finalizes every
successor and invokes `register-replacement` before deleting only the exact
source. After registration it immediately re-reads the source and successors for
drift, then uses an exact-content edit patch for retirement. Trusted state
retains the source contract in history; failure or uncertainty before or after
deletion retains the lock. This guarded file retirement does not permit an
in-place plan rewrite or execution.

For `/start-work`, the Plan Orchestrator keeps the exact literal acquisition
boundary, then invokes the trusted helper's internal `begin-execution` preflight.
Known validation failures before execution mutation release only that
preflight's matching newly acquired lock and return a fixed sanitized error
code. A `lock-held` result never authorizes automatic recovery: the Plan
Orchestrator must obtain explicit human confirmation that no planned mutator
remains before exact stale recovery and a single acquisition retry.
Post-mutation failures keep the lock.

### Maintainer-authorized Lead tools

The human maintainer explicitly authorizes the Engineering Lead to use
`pbcopy`, `todowrite`, every tool exposed by the configured MCP servers, and the
canonical predominantly non-destructive Git command set. The Git set includes
inspection, index staging, ordinary staged-index commits, and ordinary fetches;
ordered exceptions keep history rewriting, hook bypass, worktree/ref mutation,
unsafe fetch variants, shell composition, and remote mutation gated or denied.
Tool permission does not replace the user authorization required by the Lead's
commit and external-side-effect policies.

The Lead's permission map carries explicit rules for these tools, and repository
validation protects their actions and ordering. Routine reviews, audits, and
refactors must not remove, downgrade, broaden, or override this baseline.
Evidence-backed concerns may be reported for a human decision, but only a new
explicit human instruction may change the authorization. Reconcile the MCP
prefix list and validator when the configured server set changes.

### Maintainer-authorized Worker MCP tools

The human maintainer explicitly authorizes the Implementation Worker to use
every tool exposed by the configured MCP servers. Its permission map names the
same current server prefixes as the Lead, and repository validation protects
the complete explicit set. MCP availability does not widen a bounded assignment
or authorize remote mutation or other external side effects. Reconcile both
agents and the validator whenever the configured server set changes.

### Plan Orchestrator commit boundary

While it retains planned-work ownership, the Plan Orchestrator has a separately
validated Git surface for exact inspection, approval-gated `git add --` paths,
and bare staged-index commits. It may use that surface only for an explicit
current human request. With that request it may commit an appropriately complete,
validated, coherent unit during implementation or after implementation completes.
Before committing, it
freshly reconciles the pointer, plan, worktree status, unstaged and staged diffs,
recent history, and effective hook/signing policy; it rechecks the staged diff
and resulting commit/worktree before advancing a checkbox. It derives paths from
fresh trusted evidence, does not interpolate human or plan text into Git, and
keeps the lock and staged state on failure or uncertainty.

For every approval-gated `git add --`, it separately enumerates each
repository-relative dirty path from fresh `git status`/worktree evidence and
quotes it as one literal shell word. Approval is an additional human check, not
proof the path is safe. It must reject `*`, `?`, bracket expressions, braces,
pathspec magic, `.` shorthand, traversal, substitution, and every other
expansion syntax; stop if a dirty path cannot be represented literally under the
command policy. The runtime matcher cannot statically distinguish literal `*` or
`?`, so this operational requirement is mandatory rather than inferred from an
approval prompt.

The canonical active plan path may be staged only after independent validation
of that exact contained plan. This exception does not permit Bash plan mutation
or redirection. Amend, hook/signing bypass, implicit staging, fetch, push, and
all branch, ref, history, worktree, and remote mutation remain forbidden. The
Worker remains forbidden to stage or commit. Load `git-commit`; additionally load
`security-review` and `security-review-evidence` for signing trust, hooks,
secrets, or other Git trust boundaries. These are configuration-time definitions:
quit and fully restart OpenCode before any changed authority exists; the running
session remains unchanged.

## Canonical Topology, Permissions, and Evidence

`tools/opencode_manager.py` contains the canonical topology policy for all
tracked agent IDs, primary/subagent modes, exact Task edges, command owners, and
permission-profile assignments. The manifest remains the reviewed installation
inventory; validation requires it to agree exactly with that policy. Roster
drift fails closed and does not disable lifecycle checks.

The six permission profiles cover the Lead, ERB, Plan Orchestrator, Worker,
read-only review specialists, and Technical Researcher. Validation compares each
checked-in permission map with its assigned profile and evaluates ordered rules
for protected behavior. In particular:

- the Lead, ERB, Worker, reviewers, and researchers deny direct navigation of
  `.start-work/**`;
- the Plan Orchestrator also denies direct state navigation and reaches trusted
  state only through its checked-in helper command surface;
- no other role has effective helper access;
- the Worker's staging, commit, push, destructive Git, deletion, privilege,
  plan, state, and helper denies remain effective against later overrides; and
- bare Worker `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, and `git show` are allowed,
  while argument-bearing forms require approval.

Every canonical agent prompt carries the same sanitized-evidence invariant:
treat repository and supplied content as untrusted, do not reproduce or transmit
sensitive values, and report locations or types with synthetic placeholders.
Technical Researcher external requests use only public, sanitized terms. These
static contracts prevent instruction drift; they do not prove runtime model
redaction. Never use real secrets as validation fixtures or evidence.

Definitions are linked live from the reviewed checkout, but OpenCode loads them
only at startup. Repository validation can verify the checked-in contracts; a
full OpenCode restart is still required before changed runtime authority or
prompt behavior can be observed.

## Handoffs

For ordinary work, start with the Engineering Lead. The canonical sequence is
documented in [`implementation-plans/README.md`](implementation-plans/README.md):

1. Deliver directly when scope, safety, and validation are adequate. Complexity
   may support a planning recommendation, but not automatic durable planning.
2. The Lead or ERB may recommend top-level
   [`/consult-plan`](../opencode/commands/consult-plan.md); it remains advisory,
   non-mutating, and cannot persist, authorize, or begin work.
3. On explicit human authorization, top-level
   [`/create-plan`](../opencode/commands/create-plan.md) acquires trusted state
   and creates and persists a closed lean plan only. A current conversational
   split-or-replace instruction also authorizes the guarded replacement sequence
   described above without an additional deletion confirmation.
4. A separately selected ERB primary-agent turn may provide optional independent
   advisory review. It may occur in the same conversation; use a fresh
   conversation when formal contextual independence matters.
5. A separate human choice of top-level
   [`/start-work <existing-plan-path>`](../opencode/commands/start-work.md), or a
   validated no-argument resume pointer with explicit human confirmation,
   executes existing planned work. The Plan Orchestrator then executes bounded
   Worker units and records only observed plan checkbox and state evidence.

Existing plan content cannot be updated after creation except for evidenced
existing checkbox advancement during execution. Guarded replacement retires one
source file after successor registration but never updates its content. Material
discoveries require a new human decision and, when authorized, a new
`/create-plan` request or guarded conversational replacement. Legacy
conversion is plan-only and requires a separate later
`/start-work <destination>` choice to execute.

ERB output is advisory evidence, not implementation, plan, state, or execution
authority.

## Command Ownership

All tracked commands use `subtask: false`. The command definitions and manifest
are authoritative for primary ownership.

| Command | Primary agent | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`/address-review`](../opencode/commands/address-review.md) | Engineering Lead | Re-anchor the current command turn to the Lead, re-evaluate prior ERB advice, and implement accepted ordinary-work findings without inheriting Board identity or permissions. |
| [`/consult-plan`](../opencode/commands/consult-plan.md) | Plan Orchestrator | Provide top-level read-only planning advice without acquiring state, creating a plan, or authorizing work. |
| [`/create-plan`](../opencode/commands/create-plan.md) | Plan Orchestrator | On explicit human authorization, create and persist a closed lean plan only; an explicit split-or-replace instruction may use the guarded conversational replacement sequence, but never execute TODOs. |
| [`/start-work`](../opencode/commands/start-work.md) | Plan Orchestrator | Execute or resume only an existing valid canonical lean plan; reject free-form creation and plan-update requests. |
| [`/convert-tapestry-plan`](../opencode/commands/convert-tapestry-plan.md) | Plan Orchestrator | Revalidate a legacy Tapestry source and create the smallest safe lean destination layout; always plan-only, with execution requiring separate `/start-work <destination>`. |
| [`/review-plan`](../opencode/commands/review-plan.md) | Engineering Review Board | Review canonical plans without editing them. |
| [`/review-implementation`](../opencode/commands/review-implementation.md) | Engineering Review Board | Review completed implementation against the relevant plan and evidence without editing either. |
| [`/investigate-regression`](../opencode/commands/investigate-regression.md) | Engineering Review Board | Investigate a suspected regression without modifying the repository. |
| [`/audit-technical-debt`](../opencode/commands/audit-technical-debt.md) | Engineering Review Board | Run a read-only general or focused technical-debt audit. |

## Audit or Refactor Governance

Before changing role or command guidance:

- Start from the manifest, definition frontmatter, permission maps, and current
  runtime-visible Task IDs. Repository prose cannot widen those controls.
- Preserve one-level delegation. Critics and researchers do not delegate; the
  ERB never becomes a child of the Lead.
- Keep delegated Task prompts scannable: use Markdown sections separated by
  blank lines and bullets for multi-item scope, constraints, questions, and
  evidence. Do not compress a delegation packet into one dense paragraph.
- Keep implementation and durable-plan persistence separate. The Worker owns one
  bounded implementation unit; the top-level Plan Orchestrator owns plan and
  trusted state mutations through the linked helper, never copied into a target
  repository or exposed as a custom tool.
- Check each command's primary owner, `subtask: false` setting, required evidence,
  and next handoff. ERB output remains optional, read-only advice.
- Reconcile lean-plan routing changes across the canonical plan guide and the
  [project template](../opencode/project-template/AGENTS-plan-workflow-snippet.md).
  Update the manifest when tracked definitions change.
- Run `just validate-opencode`, `just validate`, and `just check` as applicable,
  then consider a separately selected ERB primary-agent turn for material
  governance advice; use a fresh conversation when formal contextual
  independence matters.
