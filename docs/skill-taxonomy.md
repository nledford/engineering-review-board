# Skill Taxonomy

This repository keeps first-party global agent skills small, focused, and
orthogonal. A skill is reusable operating guidance for a recurring task. It is
not a project diary, changelog, broad philosophy document, or dumping ground for
unloaded templates.

## Domain Model

- **Skill:** A directory under `skills/` with `SKILL.md` frontmatter and focused
  procedural guidance.
- **Trigger:** The frontmatter `description` tells the orchestrator when to load
  the skill. It must name the task surface and non-goals when confusion is
  likely.
- **Instructions:** The body explains what the agent should inspect, decide,
  change, verify, and report.
- **Constraints:** Guardrails that prevent misuse, overreach, unsafe actions, or
  stale evidence.
- **Examples:** Minimal scenarios only when they clarify activation or output
  quality.
- **Resources:** Optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, or `assets/`
  files. First-party resources must be linked from `SKILL.md` and must not
  contain broken local links.
- **Validation:** `tools/skills_manager.py validate` checks metadata, first-party
  local links, and reachable resource files.

## Taxonomy

| Category | Skills | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill authoring and governance | `create-agent-skill`, `code-review`, `review-verification-protocol`, `security-review-evidence` | Creating, validating, reviewing, and sanitizing durable agent guidance. |
| Design methods | `brainstorming`, `behavior-driven-development`, `domain-driven-design`, `test-driven-development`, `gherkin` | Use the direct method skill that matches the work; do not load a meta-selection skill. |
| Debugging and prevention | `systematic-debugging`, `root-cause-analysis` | Active symptom diagnosis first; postmortem and recurrence prevention after the direct cause is understood. |
| Data engineering | `postgresql-sql-engineering`, `sqlite-sql-engineering` | Language-independent PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL schema, migration, query, transaction, performance, security, and review guidance. |
| Python engineering | `python-engineering` | Python implementation, review, testing, packaging, dependency management, quality gates, and `uv` workflows. |
| Rust engineering | `rust-engineering`, `rust-testing-quality`, `rust-async-web`, `rust-persistence-sql`, `rust-code-review` | Project-neutral Rust implementation, tests and quality gates, async/web/full-stack work, SQLx/SeaQuery persistence, and review. |
| JavaScript and TypeScript tooling | `bun-javascript-workflows` | Bun-backed JS/TS runtime, package, script, test, workspace, and workflow guidance without assuming a frontend framework. |
| Project workflow tools | `git-commit`, `justfiles`, `playwright-e2e`, `context7-docs`, `suggest-lucide-icons` | Narrow operational guidance for common repository workflows and external documentation/icon checks. |
| Third-party runtime installs | `agent-browser`, `anti-ai-slop-writing`, `find-skills`, `playwright-cli` | Installed locally for runtime use but ignored or lockfile-owned; do not edit as first-party skills. |

## Language And Data Boundaries

| Skill | Use For | Do Not Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postgresql-sql-engineering` | PostgreSQL/SQL schema design, migrations, constraints, indexes, views, transactions, query writing, query plans, RLS, privileges, performance, and database review in any language stack. | Rust SQLx/SeaQuery typing, Python adapter code, SQLite-only behavior, or ORM API usage with no database-native change. |
| `sqlite-sql-engineering` | SQLite schema design, migrations, constraints, indexes, transactions, PRAGMAs, locking, local/embedded database behavior, temporary database tests, and SQLite query review in any language stack. | PostgreSQL-native features, Rust SQLx/SeaQuery adapter choices, or using SQLite as proof of another database's behavior. |
| `python-engineering` | Python source, tests, packaging, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `uv`, Ruff/type/test gates, refactoring, and Python code review. | Non-Python package managers, database-native schema design, or browser E2E test design. |
| `bun-javascript-workflows` | Bun runtime/package/script/test/workspace workflows, `package.json`, `bun.lock`, JS/TS quality gates, and one-off CLIs. | Checked-in Playwright test design, framework-specific frontend architecture, or Rust/Python/database work. |

## Rust Skill Boundaries

| Skill | Use For | Do Not Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rust-engineering` | Core Rust implementation, crate/workspace setup, feature flags, ownership/lifetimes, traits/generics, error design, refactoring, design patterns, and macros. | Test-runner strategy, SQLx/SeaQuery/database specifics, or framework-specific async/web design except as boundary context. |
| `rust-testing-quality` | Rust unit/integration/e2e/property/doctest/compile-fail tests, TDD/BDD loops, `cargo fmt`, `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo test --doc`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo nextest`. | General debugging without a known failing symptom, or SQLx/database-specific validation beyond naming the needed gate. |
| `rust-async-web` | Tokio, async tasks, cancellation, timeouts, channels, backpressure, shared state, Axum, Leptos, Axum-Leptos, SSR, hydration, and WASM target concerns. | SQL schema/query design or generic Rust refactors with no async/web surface. |
| `rust-persistence-sql` | SQLx queries/macros, SeaQuery builders, Rust database adapters, pools, transactions, SQLx offline metadata, SQLite support, dynamic SQL construction, and Rust persistence boundaries. | Database-native PostgreSQL or SQLite schema/query/index/security review; use `postgresql-sql-engineering` or `sqlite-sql-engineering`. |
| `rust-code-review` | Requested reviews of Rust changes and Rust-specific risk triage across the other Rust skills. | Implementation work where the user has not asked for a review, or database-only review without Rust code. |

## Method Selection

- Use **BDD** when externally observable behavior, workflows, or acceptance
  criteria need concrete examples.
- Use **DDD** when naming, boundaries, invariants, or long-term domain model
  clarity matter.
- Use **TDD** when implementation behavior can be specified and protected with
  executable tests.
- Use **Gherkin** when formal `.feature` syntax or durable Given/When/Then
  artifacts are useful.
- Use **Brainstorming** only when there are multiple credible paths and tradeoffs
  worth comparing before implementation.

Prefer one focused practice over several shallow ones.

## Inventory Decisions

| Skill | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `behavior-driven-development` | Keep | Clear boundary for behavior examples and acceptance criteria. |
| `bun-javascript-workflows` | Add | Extracted project-neutral Bun package/script/test/lockfile guidance from Chidori's local Bun workflow skill. |
| `brainstorming` | Keep | Useful for ambiguous engineering choices; non-goals are explicit. |
| `cargo-clippy` | Merge into `rust-testing-quality` | Clippy is one Rust quality gate, not a standalone durable workflow. |
| `cargo-nextest` | Merge into `rust-testing-quality` | Nextest belongs with Rust testing strategy, filtering, and reporting. |
| `code-review` | Update | General review owns finding format and severity; specialist skills add Rust, PostgreSQL/SQLite/SQL, Python, Bun, browser, security, and workflow lenses. |
| `context7-docs` | Keep | Covers current third-party docs lookup without replacing repo inspection. |
| `create-agent-skill` | Keep | Canonical authoring workflow for new or updated skills. |
| `domain-driven-design` | Keep | Clear domain modeling boundary and anti-ceremony guidance. |
| `gherkin` | Keep | Focused syntax and quality guidance for `.feature` and scenario writing. |
| `git-commit` | Keep | Broad but coherent commit-quality workflow. |
| `justfiles` | Keep | Detailed because Justfile syntax and safety rules are operationally sharp. |
| `playwright-e2e` | Keep | Distinct from browser automation; owns checked-in Playwright tests. |
| `postgresql-sql-engineering` | Add | Extracted generic PostgreSQL schema, SQL review, performance, migration, transaction, RLS, and privilege guidance from Chidori's PostgreSQL skills and removed that overlap from Rust persistence. |
| `python-engineering` | Add | Extracted Python typing, async, error-handling, pytest fixture, parametrization, mocking, and review gates from Chidori's Python review skills; added project-neutral `uv` and packaging workflow. |
| `review-verification-protocol` | Keep | Required evidence gate for review findings. |
| `root-cause-analysis` | Keep | Postmortem and recurrence-prevention workflow remains distinct from active debugging. |
| `rust-async-web` | Add | Covers Tokio, Axum, Leptos, Axum-Leptos, SSR/hydration, WASM, and full-stack boundaries. |
| `rust-code-review` | Rewrite | Review now routes to concise Rust workflow skills instead of a large reference library. |
| `rust-engineering` | Add | Covers core Rust implementation, setup, refactoring, design patterns, and macros. |
| `rust-persistence-sql` | Update | Covers SQLx, SeaQuery, SQLite adapter work, dynamic SQL construction, Rust database adapters, and persistence boundaries; delegates database-native PostgreSQL and SQLite design to data skills. |
| `rust-testing-quality` | Add | Consolidates Rust testing, Rustdoc tests, Clippy, nextest, and CI evidence. |
| `rustdoc-guidance` | Merge into `rust-testing-quality` | Rustdoc examples and doctests are part of test and API quality workflow. |
| `security-review-evidence` | Keep | Sanitized evidence checklist for security-sensitive changes. |
| `sqlite-sql-engineering` | Add | Fills the project-neutral SQLite gap: schema, constraints, PRAGMAs, transactions, locking, temp database tests, and SQLite-vs-PostgreSQL correctness boundaries. |
| `suggest-lucide-icons` | Keep | Focused icon-selection workflow. |
| `systematic-debugging` | Keep | Strong active-failure workflow; clear handoff to RCA. |
| `test-driven-development` | Keep | Concise and directly actionable for behavior/test changes. |

## Chidori Extraction Decisions

| Chidori Source | Global Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bun-workflows` | Extract into `bun-javascript-workflows` | Kept reusable Bun install/script/test/lockfile/CLI translation guidance; removed Chidori paths, Playwright recipe names, pinned versions, and Rust/Leptos topology. |
| `python-code-review`, `pytest-code-review` | Extract into `python-engineering` | Kept typing, async, exception, fixture, parametrization, mocking, and review false-positive gates; removed narrow review-only structure and copied examples. |
| `postgresql-code-review`, `postgresql-table-design`, `postgresql-optimization` | Extract into `postgresql-sql-engineering` | Kept constraints, FK index reminders, data type judgment, JSONB/range/full-text/index guidance, safe migrations, RLS/privilege checks, and plan-based review; removed project schema fragments, version pinning, and heavy tutorials. |
| `rust-best-practices`, `rust-refactor`, `rust-project-setup`, `rust-testing`, `rust-async-patterns`, `tokio-async-code-review`, `axum-code-review`, `leptos-guide`, `macros-code-review`, `serde-code-review`, `rust-wasm`, `sqlx-code-review` | Absorb into existing Rust skills | Current global Rust skills already cover these domains. Reusable bits were folded into boundaries and checklists where needed instead of adding narrow duplicate skills. |
| `rust-fullstack`, `sqlx-postgres`, `chidori-impeccable`, `leptos-mcp-server`, `utoipa-axum`, `impeccable` resources | Do not globalize | These contain Chidori-specific architecture, local MCP/tooling, exact schema workflow, UI policy, OpenAPI stack choices, or large specialized resources not justified as first-party global skills. |

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Core Rust implementation uses the engineering skill
  Given an agent changes crate layout, ownership, traits, errors, features, refactors, or macros
  When it chooses Rust guidance
  Then it loads rust-engineering
  And keeps testing, async/web, and persistence details in their specialist skills
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Rust quality gates are consolidated
  Given an agent writes Rust tests or runs cargo fmt, cargo check, cargo test, cargo test --doc, cargo clippy, or cargo nextest
  When it needs test and validation guidance
  Then it loads rust-testing-quality
  And remembers that nextest does not run doctests
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Async full-stack Rust uses framework-specific boundaries
  Given a change touches Tokio tasks, Axum handlers, Leptos server functions, SSR, hydration, or WASM
  When the agent plans or reviews the work
  Then it loads rust-async-web
  And keeps domain rules testable outside HTTP and UI framework code
```

```gherkin
Scenario: SQL-backed Rust uses persistence guidance
  Given a change touches SQLx queries, SeaQuery builders, Rust database adapters, SQLx metadata, SQLite adapter behavior, dynamic SQL construction, or Rust transaction code
  When the agent implements or reviews the work
  Then it loads rust-persistence-sql
  And validates Rust query types, adapter behavior, and database effects
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Dynamic Rust SQL uses SeaQuery only when justified
  Given a Rust change needs optional filters, sorts, joins, projections, predicates, or multiple SQL dialects
  When explicit static SQL would become unsafe or hard to review
  Then the agent may use SeaQuery through rust-persistence-sql
  And keeps sqlx as the execution, pooling, transaction, migration, or row-mapping layer when the project already uses sqlx
```

```gherkin
Scenario: PostgreSQL design is language-independent
  Given a change touches PostgreSQL tables, constraints, indexes, views, transactions, privileges, RLS, migrations, or query plans
  When the agent chooses specialist guidance
  Then it loads postgresql-sql-engineering
  And keeps Rust SQLx/SeaQuery, Python, or Bun adapter details in their language skills
```

```gherkin
Scenario: SQLite design uses SQLite-specific guidance
  Given a change touches SQLite schema, constraints, indexes, PRAGMAs, locking, migrations, transactions, temporary databases, or SQLite-backed tests
  When the agent chooses specialist guidance
  Then it loads sqlite-sql-engineering
  And does not use SQLite-only evidence to claim PostgreSQL or MySQL behavior
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Python work uses uv-aware engineering guidance
  Given a change touches Python source, tests, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, packaging, linting, typing, or dependency management
  When the agent plans implementation or review
  Then it loads python-engineering
  And verifies behavior with the repo's configured uv, test, lint, format, type, or build lanes
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Bun work stays framework-neutral
  Given a change touches package.json, bun.lock, Bun scripts, Bun tests, JS/TS runtime code, or one-off package CLIs
  When the agent chooses workflow guidance
  Then it loads bun-javascript-workflows
  And does not assume React, Vite, Next.js, Playwright, ESLint, or Prettier unless the repository config shows them
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Chidori extraction remains sanitized
  Given project-specific Chidori skills contain local paths, domain names, schema fragments, pinned versions, exact recipes, or architecture decisions
  When reusable guidance is extracted into global skills
  Then the global skill keeps only project-neutral workflows, checklists, commands, and review criteria
  And no Chidori-specific assumption becomes global policy
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Rust review uses the specialist lens
  Given an agent reviews Rust code
  When it identifies Rust-specific risk
  Then it loads rust-code-review with code-review and review-verification-protocol
  And reports only verified behavior, contract, safety, performance, or maintainability findings
```

```gherkin
Scenario: First-party resources are reachable
  Given a first-party skill contains a reference, script, template, or asset
  When repository validation runs
  Then every resource file is reachable from SKILL.md through local Markdown links
  And every local Markdown link resolves to an existing file
```
