# Skill Taxonomy

This repository keeps first-party global agent skills small, focused, and
orthogonal. A skill is reusable operating guidance for a recurring task. It is
not a project diary, changelog, broad philosophy document, or dumping ground for
unloaded templates.

## Domain Model

- **Skill:** A directory under `skills/` with `SKILL.md` frontmatter and focused
  procedural guidance. A skill is loaded procedure, not a runtime Task agent ID,
  and it grants no edit, delegation, review, or approval authority. Use the
  [engineering agent governance guide](engineering-agent-governance.md) when a
  skill routes work to an agent or command.
- **Trigger:** The frontmatter `description` is routing metadata. It must name the
  task surface and the strongest trigger terms before the skill body is loaded.
- **Instructions:** The body explains what the agent should inspect, decide,
  change, verify, and report.
- **Constraints:** Guardrails that prevent misuse, overreach, unsafe actions, or
  stale evidence.
- **Examples:** Minimal scenarios only when they clarify activation, output shape,
  or a common mistake.
- **Resources:** Optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, or `assets/`
  files. First-party resources must be linked from `SKILL.md` and must not
  contain broken local links.
- **Third-party skill:** A local runtime install under `skills/` that is listed
  in `.skill-lock.json` or ignored as a skill directory under `skills/` in
  `.gitignore`.
  `.skill-lock.json` may be absent when no skills are managed through the
  installer lockfile; ignored skill directories are still third-party.
- **Validation:** `tools/skills_manager.py validate` checks metadata, first-party
  local links, reachable resource files, this document's current first-party
  inventory, and explicit required related-skill link rules as warnings.

## Skill Quality Rubric

Use this rubric when creating, editing, splitting, merging, renaming, or deleting
first-party skills. Use the concise
[`skill-review-checklist.md`](skill-review-checklist.md) during review and
handoff.

### Purpose and Activation

- The skill does one coherent job with a durable workflow.
- The `description` front-loads trigger words, file types, tools, domains, and
  task verbs that should load the skill.
- Near-miss exclusions are explicit when adjacent skills could otherwise compete.
- The skill has a clear non-trigger boundary; agents can tell when not to load it.

### Scope and Progressive Disclosure

- `SKILL.md` contains the routing cues, core workflow, safety rules, and final
  evidence expectations needed on most uses.
- Long examples, detailed reference material, templates, compatibility notes, and
  failure-class appendices live in linked support files.
- Support files are loaded only when they help the active task; avoid chained or
  deeply nested references.
- Do not add empty `references/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, or `assets/` folders.

### Workflow Reliability

- Instructions are operational: inspect, decide, edit, test, review, report.
- Repository evidence beats generic advice. Skills should tell agents to inspect
  local configs, scripts, tests, docs, and existing conventions before changing
  behavior.
- Validation instructions name the strongest relevant checks and when to start
  narrow before broadening.
- Failure, skipped validation, and residual risk reporting must be explicit.

### Safety and Editing Discipline

- Skills must preserve unrelated user changes and avoid broad rewrites unless the
  task explicitly requires them.
- Security-sensitive work must avoid printing secrets and should route to
  `security-review` and `security-review-evidence` where applicable.
- Randomness, IDs, tokens, filenames, and fixtures must distinguish secure
  randomness from deterministic seeded reproducibility.
- Scripts should be deterministic, non-interactive where possible, have clear
  errors, and use dry-run or preview behavior for risky side effects.

### Examples, Counterexamples, and Markdown

- Examples are short, realistic, transferable, and maintained by docs/tests when
  practical.
- Counterexamples are used sparingly to prevent common false activation or bad
  output shapes.
- Markdown headings, lists, links, and code fences are consistent and scannable.
- Avoid vague motivational prose, generic best-practice dumping, duplicated
  policy, and AI-sounding filler.

### Cross-Skill Relationships and Duplication Control

- Split skills when activation conditions differ materially.
- Merge skills when they are mostly duplicate checklists with the same trigger.
- Cross-reference related skills only when the relationship helps routing or
  execution.
- Use [`docs/cross-reference-map.md`](cross-reference-map.md) for compact
  routing matrices and validator-required relationships. Keep validator rules
  explicit and category-based where practical; do not infer requirements from
  arbitrary prose. Keep this taxonomy focused on inventory, boundaries, and
  coverage.
- The validator consumes the three-column `Category`, `Skills`, and `Boundary`
  table under `## Taxonomy`. Preserve that heading and table shape, and list
  skill IDs as backticked references in the `Skills` column.
- Keep vendor/tool-specific advice in the narrowest skill that needs it; use
  project-neutral wording elsewhere.
- Keep every first-party skill transferable across target repositories. Derive
  project names, modules, paths, workflow recipes, frameworks, and validation
  commands from local evidence; use placeholders for machine paths and keep
  ecosystem-specific examples conditional rather than universal.
- Retire stale skills instead of preserving compatibility for old names.

### Maintenance Burden

- Prefer concise first-party guidance over large universal skills.
- Add helper scripts only when they materially improve repeatability.
- Update this taxonomy inventory whenever first-party skills change.
- Validate should-trigger and should-not-trigger scenarios mentally, and run the
  repository validator before handoff.

## API and Observability Skill Boundaries

These first-party contracts document boundaries shared by the taxonomy,
cross-reference map, and validator-required related-link rules. The skill files
remain the source of truth for frontmatter descriptions and detailed workflows.

### `observability-engineering`

Boundary rules:

- Owns telemetry semantics, signal quality, labels/cardinality, context
  propagation, dashboards, alerts, SLOs, and operational visibility.
- Use language engineering skills for implementation mechanics in Rust, Python,
  JavaScript, or TypeScript. Add `observability-engineering` only when the task
  needs instrumentation design or signal review, not because code happens to log.
- Use `rust-async-web` for Tokio/Axum/Leptos runtime, handler, task, SSR,
  hydration, and backpressure behavior. Add `observability-engineering` when the
  primary decision is trace/span structure, async context propagation, request
  correlation, metrics, dashboards, or alerts.
- Use SQL skills for schema, query, transaction, index, privilege, RLS, and
  query-plan behavior. Add `observability-engineering` only for database
  telemetry such as slow-query signals, pool metrics, audit-log shape, or alert
  thresholds.
- Use architecture skills when ports/adapters, dependency direction,
  domain/application rings, or system boundaries are the main design question;
  observability should not introduce architecture ceremony by itself.
- Use `security-review` and `security-review-evidence` when telemetry can expose
  secrets, credentials, PII, tenant data, auth/session traces, exploit payloads,
  or when logs/alerts are security controls or report evidence.
- Use BDD/TDD skills when acceptance examples or executable tests drive the work;
  observability owns what must be observable, not the test methodology.
- Use `documentation-engineering` for runbooks, dashboard notes, API docs,
  comments, and examples when the work is documentation-only.
- Use `systematic-debugging` for active failures and `root-cause-analysis` for
  recurrence prevention unless the fix requires durable instrumentation or
  operational signal design.

### `api-design`

Boundary rules:

- Owns externally visible contract semantics: resource and operation shape,
  request/response/error envelopes, versioning, compatibility, idempotency,
  pagination/filtering/sorting, webhook/event schemas, and machine-readable
  contract artifacts.
- Use language engineering skills for implementation mechanics, type modeling,
  package/tool workflow, generated clients, and tests in a specific language.
- Use `rust-async-web` for Axum extractors, routers, middleware, Leptos server
  functions, Tokio tasks, SSR/hydration, and Rust web runtime concerns. Add
  `api-design` only when the public or service contract itself is being shaped.
- Use SQL skills for database schemas, migrations, constraints, indexes, query
  plans, and data integrity. Database schema design is not API design unless the
  schema is directly published as an external contract.
- Use Clean, Hexagonal, Onion, or DDD skills when dependency direction,
  ports/adapters, domain language, aggregates, or application boundaries are the
  main question. Add `api-design` only for the exposed interface contract.
- Use `security-review` for auth, authorization, scopes, CORS/CSRF/CSP,
  redirects/callbacks, input validation, webhooks/signatures, sensitive data
  exposure, rate limits, abuse controls, or trust-boundary behavior in the API.
- Use BDD/TDD skills for behavior examples, contract tests, regression tests, or
  test-level selection. API design owns the contract; testing skills own the test
  workflow.
- Use `observability-engineering` for API telemetry, audit/event logs, request
  correlation, SLOs, dashboards, and alerting.
- Use `documentation-engineering` for reference docs, examples, changelogs, and
  API prose when the contract has already been decided.

## Cross-Stack Migration and Evolution Guidance

Do not add a migration meta-skill for ordinary evolution work. Route by the
primary compatibility risk, then add only the companion skill needed for evidence:

- **API compatibility:** use `api-design` for public contract semantics,
  versioning, deprecation, compatibility, and client/provider obligations. Add
  `semantic-versioning` when the release delta needs a patch, minor, major, or
  prerelease recommendation or metadata bump. Add
  language skills for implementation and
  `documentation-engineering` for migration notes after the contract is settled.
- **Database migration safety:** use `sql-engineering` plus the PostgreSQL or
  SQLite skill when engine behavior matters. Add language persistence skills only
  for adapter, transaction, backfill, or generated-query changes.
- **Telemetry migration signals:** use `observability-engineering` for adoption
  metrics, canary signals, SLO/alert changes, rollback thresholds, and evidence
  that old paths can be removed.
- **Rollout and rollback evidence:** keep feature-flag, deploy, and client code in
  the relevant language/workflow skill; use observability for the signals and
  documentation for runbooks or release notes.
- **Architecture seams:** use DDD, Clean, Hexagonal, or Onion only when the
  migration introduces durable bounded contexts, ports/adapters, dependency-rule
  pressure, or compatibility adapters. Avoid architecture ceremony for a simple
  schema or endpoint version change.
- **Client migration notes:** use `documentation-engineering` for migration
  guides, deprecation windows, examples, and changelog prose; add `api-design` or
  a language skill only if the contract or SDK/example code is still changing.

This section is routing guidance only; keep inventory and validator-required
rules in their dedicated sections.

## Third-Party Install Commands

Third-party classification and update operations are separate:

- `just update-third-party` runs the configured installer update command for
  third-party installs.
- `just update-third-party-dry-run` prints that update command without running
  it.
- `just sync-third-party-lock` copies the repository `.skill-lock.json` to
  `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` for installer compatibility. It does not run the
  update command or update third-party skill directories.

Run `sync-third-party-lock` only when a repository lockfile exists and should be
mirrored for the installer. A missing `.skill-lock.json` is normal when no
lockfile-managed skills are installed; ignored directories under `skills/` still
count as third-party skills.

## Security Skill Boundaries

| Skill | Use For | Do Not Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `threat-modeling` | Design-time security analysis for new or changed trust boundaries, actors, assets, data flows, entry points, abuse cases, mitigations, security acceptance criteria, assumptions, and residual risk. | Ordinary code review, confirmed vulnerability validation, exploit reproduction, or dependency/SBOM/CVE/provenance review. |
| `security-review` | Implemented-control review for auth, authorization, crypto, secrets, sessions, input validation, web controls, file paths, command execution, and other concrete trust-boundary behavior. | Design-only modeling before controls exist, supply-chain-only review, or unverified vulnerability claims without repository evidence. |
| `security-review-evidence` | Sanitized evidence handling for security-sensitive changes and review findings. | Standalone security review, threat modeling, or implementation work without a security evidence/reporting need. |
| `dependency-supply-chain-review` | Dependency, package, binary, registry, manifest, lockfile, SBOM/SCA, CVE/GHSA, provenance, install-script, CI bootstrap, container/base-image, vendored-code, and generated-code supply-chain risk. | Routine package-manager workflow, third-party API documentation lookup, or language-specific dependency implementation with no supply-chain security question. |

## Language and Data Boundaries

| Skill | Use For | Do Not Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sql-engineering` | Database-neutral SQL reading, writing, refactoring, schema/query review, migrations, transactions, and performance reasoning. | Engine-specific behavior that needs PostgreSQL or SQLite semantics, or language adapter code with no SQL/schema change. |
| `postgresql-sql-engineering` | PostgreSQL schema design, migrations, constraints, indexes, views, transactions, RLS, privileges, JSONB, query plans, maintenance, and database review in any language stack. | Rust SQLx/SeaQuery typing, Python adapter code, SQLite-only behavior, or ORM API usage with no database-native change. |
| `sqlite-sql-engineering` | SQLite schema design, migrations, constraints, indexes, transactions, PRAGMAs, locking, WAL, local/embedded behavior, temporary DB tests, and SQLite query review in any language stack. | PostgreSQL-native features, Rust SQLx/SeaQuery adapter choices, or using SQLite as proof of another database's behavior. |
| `random-data-identifiers` | Random numbers, secure tokens, UUIDs/CUIDs/ULIDs, collision-resistant IDs, deterministic seeded tests, fixtures, simulations, and reproducibility. | Fixed examples with no randomness or database-native ID/index design without generated-value decisions. |
| `script-engineering` | Cross-language automation scripts, runtime discovery, POSIX shell/Bash/zsh/Fish/PowerShell/Python/Ruby/Node selection, script suitability, shared safety contracts, behavioral testing, package/task-runner boundaries, and Just integration. | Running an existing script or recipe without changing it, ordinary application code with no automation surface, or hosted CI/container semantics beyond invoked commands. |
| `python-engineering` | Python source, tests, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, packaging, linting, typing, docstrings, dependency management, async task/queue execution, and Python review. | Non-Python package managers, database-native schema design, browser E2E test design, or hosted CI/release provider configuration. |
| `ruby-engineering` | Ruby source, scripts, gems, Gemfile/Gemfile.lock, Bundler, Rake, Minitest, RSpec, RuboCop, CLIs, idioms, anti-patterns, and Ruby review. | Generic script-language selection with no Ruby implementation, non-Ruby package workflows, or framework-specific behavior better owned elsewhere. |
| `powershell-engineering` | Cross-platform `.ps1`/`.psm1`/`.psd1` implementation, advanced functions/modules, objects and streams, native commands, errors, `SupportsShouldProcess`, Pester, PSScriptAnalyzer, and Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility. | Running an existing PowerShell command, generic language selection with no PowerShell implementation, or Windows-only platform administration outside a repository script change. |
| `python-design-patterns` | Python-specific design patterns such as dataclasses, value objects, protocols, context managers, supervised task groups, adapters, repositories, factories, and Python expression of Clean/Hexagonal/Onion boundaries. | General Python workflow, package management, async execution policy, or smell-focused anti-pattern review. |
| `python-antipatterns` | Python-specific generated-code and design smells such as mutable defaults, global state, import-time side effects, broad `Any`, broad exceptions, framework/ORM leakage, async blocking, and brittle tests. | Positive pattern selection or ordinary Python workflow. |
| `javascript-typescript-engineering` | JS/TS source, package.json, lockfiles, Node/npm, Bun, Deno, pnpm, or Yarn workflows, TypeScript, lint/format/test/build scripts, dependencies, workspaces, and JS/TS review. | Checked-in Playwright spec design, Rust/Python/database work, or CSS/SCSS styling decisions without JS/TS implementation or tooling impact. |
| `css-scss-styling` | CSS, SCSS/Sass, Tailwind CSS, CSS modules, CSS-in-JS styling choices, utility-class conventions, design tokens, cascade/layers, source detection, container/media queries, responsive layout, browser compatibility, and styling-system migration. | Pure JS/TS/Python/Rust behavior changes, API/data work, checked-in browser E2E strategy, or vendor-specific framework setup with no styling surface. |
| `typescript-javascript-design-patterns` | TypeScript/JavaScript-specific design patterns such as discriminated unions, branded types, runtime validation boundaries, adapter modules, functional core/imperative shell, use-case handlers, async orchestration, and test builders. | Package manager workflows, checked-in Playwright spec design, or smell-focused anti-pattern review. |
| `typescript-javascript-antipatterns` | TypeScript/JavaScript smells such as `any`, unsafe assertions, missing runtime validation, unawaited promises, singleton service bags, import-time side effects, framework/UI leakage, weak randomness, over-mocked tests, and brittle E2E tests. | Positive pattern selection or ordinary JS/TS workflow. |
| `documentation-engineering` | Markdown, README, API docs, code comments, docstrings, Rustdoc, pydoc, Javadoc, JSDoc/TSDoc, perldoc/POD, examples, documentation tests, and review. | Code-only behavior changes with no reader-facing documentation or comment impact; standalone docs remain outside an explicitly code-only assignment unless used as evidence. |

### Future Python and TypeScript/JavaScript Split Triggers

These are not backlog items. Split `python-engineering` or
`javascript-typescript-engineering` only after repeated tasks show a durable
activation boundary that would make the broad language skill noisy or
under-specific. Cross-stack UI and accessibility audits now route to
`ux-accessibility-review`; implementation remains with styling, language, i18n,
and browser-test skills.

- **Testing:** recurring work is mostly test strategy, fixtures, runner behavior,
  coverage, flake isolation, or CI lane selection across projects, rather than
  implementation plus its normal tests. Keep checked-in browser E2E work in
  `playwright-e2e`.
- **Packaging and toolchains:** package metadata, builds, publishing, lockfiles,
  workspaces, or dependency resolution become version-sensitive enough that they
  can be handled without loading general implementation guidance. Keep checked-in
  provider workflows and automated publication in `ci-release-engineering`.
- **Web/API frameworks:** framework routing, middleware, request lifecycles,
  server/client boundaries, SSR, validation adapters, or framework-specific test
  harnesses dominate the task. Keep public contract shape in `api-design` and
  security controls in the security skills.
- **Async and concurrency:** cancellation, backpressure, task lifetimes, queues,
  workers, event loops, shared state, or resource cleanup are the primary risk;
  do not split for routine `await` usage.
- **Anti-pattern review:** create narrower smell-review skills only when one
  repeated review surface has its own evidence rules and false-positive risks.
  Do not split merely to add more examples to the existing anti-pattern skills.

Apply the same evidence threshold to `ruby-engineering`. Keep idioms,
anti-patterns, testing, gems, and ordinary framework-adjacent Ruby together until
repeated tasks show that a Ruby testing, packaging, design-pattern, anti-pattern,
or framework skill has a distinct activation boundary and evidence workflow.

## Rust Skill Boundaries

| Skill | Use For | Do Not Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rust-engineering` | Core Rust implementation, crate/workspace setup, feature flags, ownership/lifetimes, traits/generics, error design, refactoring, design patterns, common crates, and macros. | Test-runner strategy, SQLx/SeaQuery/database specifics, or framework-specific async/web design except as boundary context. |
| `rust-design-patterns` | Rust-specific pattern and idiom choices such as newtypes, enums, RAII guards, builders, traits as ports, compose-structs, small crates, contained unsafe modules, custom traits for complex bounds, and macros. | Broader Rust workflow, cargo quality gates, persistence-specific work, or smell-focused anti-pattern review. |
| `rust-antipatterns` | Rust-specific generated-code and design smells such as clone-to-satisfy-borrow-checker, reflexive shared mutability, deref polymorphism, crate-root deny-warnings, panic at trust boundaries, async overuse, macro overreach, and framework leakage. | Positive pattern selection or ordinary Rust implementation. |
| `rust-testing-quality` | Rust unit/integration/e2e/property/doctest/compile-fail tests, TDD/BDD loops, `cargo fmt`, `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo test --doc`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo nextest`, and Bacon feedback jobs. | General debugging without a known failing symptom, framework-specific server/client coordination, or SQLx/database-specific validation beyond naming the needed gate. |
| `rust-async-web` | Tokio, async tasks, cancellation, timeouts, channels, backpressure, shared state, Axum, Leptos, Axum-Leptos, SSR, hydration, and WASM target concerns. | SQL schema/query design or generic Rust refactors with no async/web surface. |
| `rust-persistence-sql` | SQLx queries/macros, SeaQuery builders, SeaORM/Diesel/raw-SQL choices, Rust database adapters, pools, transactions, SQLx offline metadata, SQLite support, dynamic SQL, and persistence boundaries. | Database-native PostgreSQL or SQLite schema/query/index/security review; use the data skills too. |
| `rust-code-review` | Requested reviews of Rust changes and Rust-specific risk triage across the other Rust skills. | Implementation work where the user has not asked for a review, or database-only review without Rust code. |

## Method Selection and Composition

- Use **BDD** when externally observable behavior, workflows, or acceptance
  criteria need concrete examples.
- Use **DDD** when naming, boundaries, invariants, or long-term domain model
  clarity matter.
- Use **Clean Architecture** when concentric policy/detail boundaries, entities,
  use cases/interactors, interface adapters, presenters, dependency direction, or
  framework/database/UI independence shape the implementation.
- Use **Hexagonal Architecture** when ports, adapters, external actors, multiple
  drivers, swappable infrastructure, or headless core testing shape the
  implementation.
- Use **Onion Architecture** when domain/application rings around a protected
  domain model are the clearest framing and infrastructure should stay outside
  those rings.
- Use **TDD** when behavior can be specified and protected with executable tests.
- Use **Gherkin** when formal `.feature` artifacts or Gherkin syntax are needed.
- Use **Brainstorming** only when there are multiple credible paths and tradeoffs
  worth comparing before implementation.
- Use **language design pattern skills** when the main decision is how to express
  a design idiomatically in Rust, Python, or TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Use **language anti-pattern skills** when the task is smell detection, generated
  code cleanup, or review of repeated language-specific failure modes.
- Use **Threat Modeling** before or during significant trust-boundary design to
  map actors, assets, entry points, data flows, abuse cases, mitigations,
  security acceptance criteria, and residual risk.
- Use **Security Review** after controls exist or when validated findings and
  sanitized evidence are required.
- Use **Dependency Supply-Chain Review** when dependency, package, binary,
  registry, lockfile, CI bootstrap, container, provenance, SBOM/SCA, or advisory
  risk is the security question.

Combinations should be proportional:

- **BDD + DDD:** when examples need domain language, invariants, roles, policies,
  or bounded-context distinctions before implementation.
- **DDD + Clean, Hexagonal, or Onion Architecture:** when the domain model needs
  protection from framework, persistence, messaging, SDK, or delivery-mechanism
  leakage. Use Clean wording for use-case/layer responsibilities; use Hexagonal
  wording for port/adapter decisions; use Onion wording for domain/application
  rings.
- **BDD + Clean, Hexagonal, or Onion Architecture:** when behavior examples should
  execute at the system, inbound-adapter, or use-case boundary without exposing
  internals.
- **BDD + TDD:** when acceptance examples should drive executable behavior tests.
- **DDD + TDD:** when domain invariants, state transitions, value objects, or
  policies should be protected with narrow tests.
- **TDD + Clean, Hexagonal, or Onion Architecture:** when use cases or
  application services should be tested with fake or in-memory adapters before
  real infrastructure exists.
- **BDD + DDD + TDD:** when a significant feature has user-visible behavior,
  important domain modeling, and executable tests that should evolve together.
- **Language engineering + design patterns:** when the implementation needs an
  idiomatic expression of a boundary, invariant, state transition, resource
  lifetime, or construction pattern.
- **Language engineering + anti-patterns:** when reviewing generated code,
  smell-heavy refactors, brittle tests, or repeated language-specific mistakes.
- **Threat modeling + BDD/TDD:** when abuse cases and mitigations should become
  user-visible acceptance criteria or executable security regression tests.
- **Threat modeling + security review:** when design-time risks need verification
  against implemented controls before they are reported as findings.
- **Dependency supply-chain review + language/workflow skills:** when manifests,
  lockfiles, package scripts, CI bootstrap, or container changes require both
  ecosystem mechanics and supply-chain trust review.
- **None of these methods:** for formatting-only, docs-only, mechanical renames,
  generated updates, routine dependency bumps with no trust or supply-chain
  question, or obvious one-line fixes with existing coverage.

Prefer one focused practice over several shallow ones. Do not add ceremony when
reading the code, making a small change, and running the relevant check is enough.

## Current First-Party Inventory

| Skill | Purpose And Trigger | Boundary Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `adversarial-review` | Independent final challenge of completed changes, agent claims, merge readiness, hidden regressions, and unsupported assumptions. | Provides a skeptical verification pass after implementation or primary review while reusing the general review evidence protocol. |
| `api-design` | API contracts for HTTP/REST, RPC/GraphQL, webhooks, events, request/response/error envelopes, pagination/filtering/sorting, idempotency, versioning, schema artifacts, SDK/CLI surfaces, and consumer/provider compatibility. | Owns contract and compatibility guidance while language, data, security, testing, observability, and documentation skills own their mechanics. |
| `architecture-review` | Architecture-focused audits of boundaries, dependency direction, ports/adapters, Clean/Hexagonal/Onion/DDD hybrids, and modular structure. | Separates architecture findings from architecture design and implementation guidance. |

## Retired, Merged, Renamed, Or Third-Party Skills

| Name Or Group | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| `bun-javascript-workflows` | Renamed and broadened to `javascript-typescript-engineering`; Node/npm is the default path, while Bun remains supported when local evidence shows a Bun-backed project. |
| `cargo-clippy`, `cargo-nextest`, `rustdoc-guidance` | Merged into `rust-testing-quality`; they are quality gates, not independent workflows. |
| Narrow Rust topic skills such as async review, Axum review, Leptos guidance, project setup, refactoring, macros, WASM, and SQLx review | Merged into the five Rust skills so activation is by durable workflow rather than library fragment. |
| Chidori project-specific skills and resources | Not part of the global taxonomy. Reusable project-neutral guidance has already been folded into language, data, and Rust skills; local paths, schema details, architecture, and workflow names remain local. |
| `agent-browser`, `anti-ai-slop-writing`, `find-skills`, `playwright-cli` | Third-party or ignored runtime installs. They may exist under `skills/` locally, but repository-owned audits should not edit them. |

## Acceptance Criteria

These scenarios are documented acceptance criteria. Treat one as executable only
when an automated test or validator check explicitly traces to it.

```gherkin
Scenario: First-party taxonomy inventory stays current
  Given a first-party skill is added, removed, or renamed
  When repository validation runs
  Then docs/skill-taxonomy.md lists exactly the current first-party skills
  And ignored or lockfile-owned third-party installs are not listed as first-party
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Third-party lock sync stays separate from updates
  Given third-party skills may be ignored under skills/ or listed in .skill-lock.json
  When an operator needs to update third-party skill contents
  Then they run update-third-party or update-third-party-dry-run
  And sync-third-party-lock only copies the repository lockfile to ~/.agents/.skill-lock.json
  And a missing repository lockfile means there are no lockfile-managed skills to sync
```

```gherkin
Scenario: First-party resources are reachable
  Given a first-party skill contains a reference, script, template, or asset
  When repository validation runs
  Then every resource file is reachable from SKILL.md through local Markdown links
  And every local Markdown link resolves to an existing file
```

```gherkin
Scenario: First-party skills remain project-neutral
  Given a first-party skill is reusable across target repositories
  When repository validation runs
  Then skill instructions and reachable text resources contain no source-project identifiers
  And machine-specific home paths use placeholders or repository-relative examples
  And repository-specific modules, recipes, frameworks, and commands are derived from target-repository evidence
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Technical-debt audits separate systemic debt from defects
  Given a user requests a repository-wide or focused technical-debt audit
  When the agent assesses accumulated maintenance cost
  Then it loads technical-debt-audit and review-verification-protocol
  And maps the repository before reporting evidence-backed findings
  And uses qualitative test coverage unless observed tooling provides numeric coverage
  And verifies current dependency status before claiming deprecation, abandonment, or vulnerability
  And prioritizes quick wins, strategic blockers, and longer-term remediation without padding categories
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Axum and Leptos debt audits use executable target-aware evidence
  Given a user explicitly requests shell-backed technical-debt evidence for an Axum and Leptos SSR repository
  When the Engineering Review Board routes the audit
  Then the technical-debt auditor remains read-only and requests approval only for its canonical evidence commands
  And it reports tool availability, exact command, exit status, and a short sanitized relevant excerpt
  And it never installs missing tools, updates dependencies, applies fixes, redirects output, or composes shell commands
  And it identifies islands versus full-page hydration before classifying hydration risk
  And it validates SSR and wasm32 hydration lanes without assuming all features are mutually compatible
  And it treats ordinary manual Axum routes outside the generated Leptos route list as expected unless wiring, collision, or reachability evidence proves drift
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Category-required related links stay explicit
  Given a first-party skill belongs to a taxonomy category with required related links
  When repository validation runs
  Then missing local SKILL.md links to those related skills are emitted as warnings
  And existing hard validation errors are still reported as errors
  And ignored or lockfile-owned third-party skills do not emit these warnings
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Security-sensitive work uses explicit review
  Given a change touches auth, crypto, secrets, sessions, input validation, CORS, CSP, CSRF, OAuth, tokens, file paths, command execution, or dependency trust
  When an agent reviews the change
  Then it loads security-review and security-review-evidence with code-review
  And reports only sanitized, verified findings
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Threat modeling stays separate from verified findings
  Given a change introduces a trust boundary, sensitive-data flow, external integration, upload, webhook, command surface, or tenant/admin distinction
  When an agent models security risk before or during implementation
  Then it loads threat-modeling
  And records actors, assets, entry points, trust boundaries, abuse cases, mitigations, security acceptance criteria, and residual risk
  And hands concrete implemented-control findings to security-review and security-review-evidence before reporting verified vulnerabilities
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Dependency supply-chain review inspects trust signals safely
  Given a change touches dependency manifests, lockfiles, SBOM or SCA output, CVE or GHSA advisories, registries, install scripts, CI bootstrap dependencies, container images, vendored code, generated code, or binaries
  When an agent reviews supply-chain risk
  Then it loads dependency-supply-chain-review with security-review and security-review-evidence
  And inspects provenance, pins, checksums, signatures, dependency-path impact, scripts, and sanitized advisory evidence without running untrusted code first
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Git operations preserve work and require exact authorization
  Given a task constructs commits or changes branches, refs, history, remotes, tags, or worktrees
  When the agent chooses Git guidance
  Then commit grouping, staging, validation, and messages load git-commit
  And repository-state operations load git-workflows
  And the agent inspects policy, current work, publication state, and affected refs before mutation
  And worktree discard, history rewriting, ref deletion, remote updates, and forced changes require explicit authorization
  And secrets, credentialed remotes, signing trust, or untrusted hooks load security-review and security-review-evidence
  And submodule, hook-tool, vendored-source, or provenance questions load dependency-supply-chain-review
  And the result, validation, skipped checks, and residual risk are reported without sensitive values
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Randomness distinguishes security from reproducibility
  Given a change generates IDs, tokens, random test data, fixtures, or simulation inputs
  When the agent chooses randomness guidance
  Then it loads random-data-identifiers
  And uses secure randomness for secrets and security-sensitive or public unguessable IDs
  And uses explicit seeded PRNGs for reproducible tests
```

```gherkin
Scenario: CI and release implementation stays separate from readiness review
  Given a change touches checked-in CI or release-provider triggers, jobs, permissions, artifacts, versioning, tags, or publication
  When the agent implements the workflow
  Then it loads ci-release-engineering
  And language and test skills own the commands run by jobs
  And security-review and security-review-evidence handle permissions, secrets, OIDC, untrusted events, and command injection
  And release-readiness remains the final ship or hold decision
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Semantic version selection follows the released public contract
  Given a release unit has a current released version and a complete change delta
  When an agent recommends or applies the next Semantic Version
  Then it loads semantic-versioning
  And identifies the declared public contract and supported consumers
  And classifies every material change by compatibility impact
  And lets the highest required patch, minor, or major bump win
  And treats 0.x, prerelease, dependency, and ambiguous de facto behavior according to explicit project policy
  And does not tag, push, publish, deploy, or make the final ship decision without the owning workflow and authorization
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Container implementation composes with security and supply-chain review
  Given a change touches Dockerfile, Containerfile, .dockerignore, OCI image construction, or Docker Compose behavior
  When the agent implements the container configuration
  Then it loads container-engineering
  And dependency-supply-chain-review handles base image, package, registry, SBOM, attestation, and provenance trust
  And security-review and security-review-evidence handle secrets, mounts, ports, capabilities, sockets, and other trust boundaries
  And ci-release-engineering owns hosted workflows that build, test, or publish the image
```

```gherkin
Scenario: JavaScript and TypeScript choose the local workflow
  Given a change touches JS/TS source, package scripts, lockfiles, type checks, linting, formatting, tests, builds, or dependencies
  When the agent chooses workflow guidance
  Then it loads javascript-typescript-engineering
  And defaults to Node/npm when no repository evidence requires another workflow
  And does not assume pnpm, yarn, Bun, Deno, React, Vite, ESLint, or Prettier without repository evidence
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Package runners distinguish local tools from fetched execution
  Given a JavaScript or TypeScript workflow needs a package CLI
  When an agent chooses package scripts, npm exec or npx, pnpm exec or pnx/dlx/pnpx, or bunx
  Then it loads javascript-typescript-engineering
  And prefers the repository's selected package manager and locked local dependency for durable work
  And treats any missing-package fetch-and-run behavior as an explicit dependency and supply-chain decision
  And does not rely on an interactive confirmation prompt in CI or another non-interactive environment
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Ruby work uses repository-owned runtime and test conventions
  Given a change touches Ruby source, scripts, gems, Bundler, Rake, Minitest, or RSpec
  When the agent implements or validates the change
  Then it loads ruby-engineering
  And derives Ruby, Bundler, dependency, style, and test commands from repository evidence
  And chooses unit, integration, CLI/process, or end-to-end coverage for the observable risk
  And uses script-engineering when the unresolved decision is Ruby versus another automation language
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Cross-platform PowerShell is tested as a platform contract
  Given a change claims PowerShell support on more than one operating system or edition
  When the agent implements or validates the script or module
  Then it loads powershell-engineering
  And distinguishes pwsh from Windows PowerShell
  And checks cmdlets, modules, paths, encodings, native commands, streams, and exit behavior on the claimed targets
  And uses Pester, PSScriptAnalyzer, and target execution proportionately without treating static analysis as runtime proof
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Rust continuous feedback uses project-level Bacon jobs
  Given a Rust repository adopts Bacon or the task asks to establish it
  And the project needs continuous check, test, lint, or server feedback
  When the agent establishes or updates the development loop
  Then it loads rust-testing-quality and writes supported jobs in bacon.toml
  And it loads rust-async-web for Axum or Leptos server and client coordination
  And it does not nest a framework-managed development server inside another file watcher
  And it runs direct repository or CI-equivalent commands for final evidence
```

```gherkin
Scenario: CSS, SCSS, and utility changes preserve the local styling system
  Given a change touches CSS, SCSS, Sass, Tailwind, CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, utility classes, design tokens, or stylesheet build config
  When the agent chooses styling guidance
  Then it loads css-scss-styling
  And detects the existing styling system and installed framework version before editing
  And preserves that system unless an explicit adoption or migration goal justifies Tailwind, CSS, or SCSS
  And validates source detection plus the generated, compiled, or browser-visible result as applicable
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Database-neutral SQL escalates to engine-specific guidance
  Given a change touches SQL, schemas, migrations, transactions, indexes, views, functions, triggers, or query performance
  When the target database has PostgreSQL or SQLite-specific behavior
  Then the agent loads sql-engineering plus the matching engine skill
  And validates behavior against the target engine rather than mocks or another database
```
