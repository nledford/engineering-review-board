# Skill Taxonomy

This repository keeps first-party global agent skills small, focused, and
orthogonal. A skill is reusable operating guidance for a recurring task. It is
not a project diary, changelog, broad philosophy document, or dumping ground for
unloaded templates.

## Domain Model

- **Skill:** A directory under `skills/` with `SKILL.md` frontmatter and focused
  procedural guidance.
- **Trigger:** The frontmatter `description` is routing metadata. It must name the
  task surface and the strongest trigger terms before the skill body is loaded.
- **Instructions:** The body explains what the agent should inspect, decide,
  change, verify, and report.
- **Constraints:** Guardrails that prevent misuse, overreach, unsafe actions, or
  stale evidence.
- **Examples:** Minimal scenarios only when they clarify activation, output shape,
  or a common mistake.
- **Resources:** Optional `references/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, or `assets/`
  files. First-party resources must be linked from `SKILL.md` and must not
  contain broken local links.
- **Validation:** `tools/skills_manager.py validate` checks metadata, first-party
  local links, reachable resource files, and this document's current first-party
  inventory.

## Skill Quality Rubric

Use this rubric when creating, editing, splitting, merging, renaming, or deleting
first-party skills.

### Purpose and Activation

- The skill does one coherent job with a durable workflow.
- The `description` front-loads trigger words, file types, tools, domains, and
  task verbs that should load the skill.
- Near-miss exclusions are explicit when adjacent skills could otherwise compete.
- The skill has a clear non-trigger boundary; agents can tell when not to load it.

### Scope and Progressive Disclosure

- `SKILL.md` contains the routing cues, core workflow, safety rules, and final
  evidence expectations needed on most uses.
- Long examples, detailed reference material, templates, compatibility notes, and
  failure-class appendices live in linked support files.
- Support files are loaded only when they help the active task; avoid chained or
  deeply nested references.
- Do not add empty `references/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, or `assets/` folders.

### Workflow Reliability

- Instructions are operational: inspect, decide, edit, test, review, report.
- Repository evidence beats generic advice. Skills should tell agents to inspect
  local configs, scripts, tests, docs, and existing conventions before changing
  behavior.
- Validation instructions name the strongest relevant checks and when to start
  narrow before broadening.
- Failure, skipped validation, and residual risk reporting must be explicit.

### Safety and Editing Discipline

- Skills must preserve unrelated user changes and avoid broad rewrites unless the
  task explicitly requires them.
- Security-sensitive work must avoid printing secrets and should route to
  `security-review` and `security-review-evidence` where applicable.
- Randomness, IDs, tokens, filenames, and fixtures must distinguish secure
  randomness from deterministic seeded reproducibility.
- Scripts should be deterministic, non-interactive where possible, have clear
  errors, and use dry-run or preview behavior for risky side effects.

### Examples, Counterexamples, and Markdown

- Examples are short, realistic, transferable, and maintained by docs/tests when
  practical.
- Counterexamples are used sparingly to prevent common false activation or bad
  output shapes.
- Markdown headings, lists, links, and code fences are consistent and scannable.
- Avoid vague motivational prose, generic best-practice dumping, duplicated
  policy, and AI-sounding filler.

### Cross-Skill Relationships and Duplication Control

- Split skills when activation conditions differ materially.
- Merge skills when they are mostly duplicate checklists with the same trigger.
- Cross-reference related skills only when the relationship helps routing or
  execution.
- Keep vendor/tool-specific advice in the narrowest skill that needs it; use
  project-neutral wording elsewhere.
- Retire stale skills instead of preserving compatibility for old names.

### Maintenance Burden

- Prefer concise first-party guidance over large universal skills.
- Add helper scripts only when they materially improve repeatability.
- Update this taxonomy inventory whenever first-party skills change.
- Validate should-trigger and should-not-trigger scenarios mentally, and run the
  repository validator before handoff.

## Method Selection and Composition

- Use **BDD** when externally observable behavior, workflows, or acceptance
  criteria need concrete examples.
- Use **DDD** when naming, boundaries, invariants, or long-term domain model
  clarity matter.
- Use **Clean Architecture** when concentric policy/detail boundaries, entities,
  use cases/interactors, interface adapters, presenters, dependency direction, or
  framework/database/UI independence shape the implementation.
- Use **Hexagonal Architecture** when ports, adapters, external actors, multiple
  drivers, swappable infrastructure, or headless core testing shape the
  implementation.
- Use **Onion Architecture** when domain/application rings around a protected
  domain model are the clearest framing and infrastructure should stay outside
  those rings.
- Use **TDD** when behavior can be specified and protected with executable tests.
- Use **Gherkin** when formal `.feature` syntax or durable Given/When/Then
  artifacts are useful.
- Use **Brainstorming** only when there are multiple credible paths and tradeoffs
  worth comparing before implementation.
- Use **language design pattern skills** when the main decision is how to express
  a design idiomatically in Rust, Python, or TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Use **language anti-pattern skills** when the task is smell detection, generated
  code cleanup, or review of repeated language-specific failure modes.

Combinations should be proportional:

- **BDD + DDD:** when examples need domain language, invariants, roles, policies,
  or bounded-context distinctions before implementation.
- **DDD + Clean, Hexagonal, or Onion Architecture:** when the domain model needs
  protection from framework, persistence, messaging, SDK, or delivery-mechanism
  leakage. Use Clean wording for use-case/layer responsibilities; use Hexagonal
  wording for port/adapter decisions; use Onion wording for domain/application
  rings.
- **BDD + Clean, Hexagonal, or Onion Architecture:** when behavior examples should
  execute at the system, inbound-adapter, or use-case boundary without exposing
  internals.
- **BDD + TDD:** when acceptance examples should drive executable behavior tests.
- **DDD + TDD:** when domain invariants, state transitions, value objects, or
  policies should be protected with narrow tests.
- **TDD + Clean, Hexagonal, or Onion Architecture:** when use cases or
  application services should be tested with fake or in-memory adapters before
  real infrastructure exists.
- **BDD + DDD + TDD:** when a significant feature has user-visible behavior,
  important domain modeling, and executable tests that should evolve together.
- **Language engineering + design patterns:** when the implementation needs an
  idiomatic expression of a boundary, invariant, state transition, resource
  lifetime, or construction pattern.
- **Language engineering + anti-patterns:** when reviewing generated code,
  smell-heavy refactors, brittle tests, or repeated language-specific mistakes.
- **None of these methods:** for formatting-only, docs-only, mechanical renames,
  generated updates, dependency bumps, or obvious one-line fixes with existing
  coverage.

Prefer one focused practice over several shallow ones. Do not add ceremony when
reading the code, making a small change, and running the relevant check is enough.

## Retired, Merged, Renamed, Or Third-Party Skills

| Name Or Group | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| `bun-javascript-workflows` | Renamed and broadened to `javascript-typescript-engineering`; Bun remains a first-class path when local evidence shows a Bun-backed project. |
| `cargo-clippy`, `cargo-nextest`, `rustdoc-guidance` | Merged into `rust-testing-quality`; they are quality gates, not independent workflows. |
| Narrow Rust topic skills such as async review, Axum review, Leptos guidance, project setup, refactoring, macros, WASM, and SQLx review | Merged into the five Rust skills so activation is by durable workflow rather than library fragment. |
| Chidori project-specific skills and resources | Not part of the global taxonomy. Reusable project-neutral guidance has already been folded into language, data, and Rust skills; local paths, schema details, architecture, and workflow names remain local. |
| `agent-browser`, `anti-ai-slop-writing`, `find-skills`, `playwright-cli` | Third-party or ignored runtime installs. They may exist under `skills/` locally, but repository-owned audits should not edit them. |

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: First-party taxonomy inventory stays current
  Given a first-party skill is added, removed, or renamed
  When repository validation runs
  Then docs/skill-taxonomy.md lists exactly the current first-party skills
  And ignored or lockfile-owned third-party installs are not listed as first-party
```

```gherkin
Scenario: First-party resources are reachable
  Given a first-party skill contains a reference, script, template, or asset
  When repository validation runs
  Then every resource file is reachable from SKILL.md through local Markdown links
  And every local Markdown link resolves to an existing file
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Security-sensitive work uses explicit review
  Given a change touches auth, crypto, secrets, sessions, input validation, CORS, CSP, CSRF, OAuth, tokens, file paths, command execution, or dependency trust
  When an agent reviews the change
  Then it loads security-review and security-review-evidence with code-review
  And reports only sanitized, verified findings
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Randomness distinguishes security from reproducibility
  Given a change generates IDs, tokens, random test data, fixtures, or simulation inputs
  When the agent chooses randomness guidance
  Then it loads random-data-identifiers
  And uses secure randomness for secrets and IDs or explicit seeded PRNGs for reproducible tests
```

```gherkin
Scenario: JavaScript and TypeScript choose the local workflow
  Given a change touches JS/TS source, package scripts, lockfiles, type checks, linting, formatting, tests, builds, or dependencies
  When the agent chooses workflow guidance
  Then it loads javascript-typescript-engineering
  And does not assume Bun, Node, pnpm, npm, yarn, Deno, React, Vite, ESLint, or Prettier without repository evidence
```

```gherkin
Scenario: Database-neutral SQL escalates to engine-specific guidance
  Given a change touches SQL, schemas, migrations, transactions, indexes, views, functions, triggers, or query performance
  When the target database has PostgreSQL or SQLite-specific behavior
  Then the agent loads sql-engineering plus the matching engine skill
  And validates behavior against the target engine rather than mocks or another database
```
