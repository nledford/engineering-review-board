# Domain-Driven Design

Use DDD to make important domain behavior explicit, correctly named, and
protected from infrastructure concerns. Apply it where the domain has enough
business meaning to justify modeling; do not turn simple CRUD or unclear ideas
into ceremony prematurely.

## When to Use

Use DDD when the work involves:

- Business rules, invariants, lifecycle transitions, policies, permissions, or
  workflows that need durable names.
- Multiple concepts that are easy to confuse without a shared vocabulary.
- Internal logic whose correctness matters beyond a single endpoint, UI screen,
  job, or database query.
- Refactoring modules so domain behavior is easier to test and maintain.
- Breaking changes that improve domain clarity and the project does not require
  backwards compatibility.

Avoid heavy DDD when:

- The change is a simple adapter, presentation tweak, migration, or one-off
  script with little domain behavior.
- The domain language is not yet known; start with simple code and preserve
  refactoring room.
- Introducing aggregates, repositories, or events would create abstractions with
  no current rule to protect.

## Workflow

1. Discover the language.
   - Extract nouns, verbs, states, roles, and constraints from the user request,
     existing tests, docs, logs, UI copy, APIs, and database names.
   - Prefer terms used by domain experts and product behavior over technical
     convenience names.
   - Record ambiguities as questions or assumptions before encoding them.

2. Find the boundaries.
   - Identify the domain and subdomains involved.
   - Look for bounded contexts where the same word means different things or
     where rules change by workflow, team, product area, or integration.
   - Keep context boundaries visible in module names, APIs, tests, and docs when
     they affect maintainability.

3. Choose tactical patterns only where they earn their keep.
   - Entity: has identity and continuity across changes.
   - Value object: immutable descriptive value whose equality is by value.
   - Aggregate: consistency boundary that protects invariants through one root.
   - Repository: collection-like access to aggregates, hiding persistence shape.
   - Domain service: stateless domain operation that does not belong on one
     entity or value object.
   - Policy/specification: named decision rule that may vary independently.
   - Domain event: fact that something meaningful already happened in the
     domain.

4. Separate domain from delivery and storage.
   - Put invariants and decisions in domain types or services, not controllers,
     resolvers, UI components, SQL snippets, serializers, or job handlers.
   - Let infrastructure translate into and out of domain concepts.
   - Keep persistence models separate from domain models when storage shape would
     leak or weaken invariants.
   - Do not let framework types become part of the core domain API unless the
     project intentionally treats them as domain primitives.

5. Preserve behavior through tests.
   - Test invariants, transitions, policies, and domain events at the narrowest
     useful level.
   - Use integration tests for repository mappings and boundary contracts.
   - Prefer behavior names in tests over implementation names.

## Modeling Guidance

- Make invalid states unrepresentable when the language and type system allow it.
- Name operations after domain actions, not data mutations: prefer
  `accept_invitation` over `update_invitation_status` when acceptance has rules.
- Keep aggregates small; do not load a whole graph just because objects are
  related.
- Use domain events for meaningful facts, not as generic callbacks.
- Let module boundaries follow cohesive behavior, not database tables by
  default.
- Refactor toward clearer bounded contexts incrementally when it improves tests,
  naming, or ownership.

## Ubiquitous Language Checklist

- Domain terms are consistent across code, tests, API names, docs, and UI copy
  where they describe the same concept.
- Different meanings use different names, even if legacy code conflates them.
- Public errors and validation messages explain domain rules in user-relevant
  language.
- New abstractions protect real invariants or decisions.
- Infrastructure names do not replace domain names in core logic.

## Common Pitfalls

- Anemic models: entities that only store data while services or handlers hold
  all domain decisions.
- Pattern cargo culting: repositories, events, factories, or aggregates added
  before there is behavior for them to protect.
- Leaky persistence: database IDs, joins, or ORM constraints dictating domain
  language without a domain reason.
- Over-preserving compatibility: keeping misleading names or boundaries when the
  project allows breaking changes and clarity is worth the migration.
