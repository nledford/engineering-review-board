# CSS, SCSS, And Tailwind Styling

Use this skill for project-neutral stylesheet work. Inspect the repository before
assuming plain CSS, SCSS/Sass, CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind CSS, another
utility framework, or a framework convention. Keep the guidance operational:
preserve local conventions, choose the simplest styling system that satisfies the
requirement, and verify the generated, compiled, and browser-visible result.

## Use When

- Editing `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `*.module.css`, `*.module.scss`, design-token
  files, global stylesheets, component styles, theme files, or stylesheet build
  config.
- Changing cascade behavior, layout, responsive behavior, accessibility-related
  visual states, browser compatibility, or style performance.
- Deciding among plain CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, or an intentional hybrid; converting
  or adopting one safely; or avoiding an unnecessary tool or migration.
- Integrating styles with static HTML, JS/TS apps, Python web templates, Rust
  Leptos/Axum apps, CSS-in-JS, CSS modules, utility CSS, or framework-specific
  styling conventions.

Do not use this skill for UI behavior with no stylesheet or browser-visible
styling change. Use [`javascript-typescript-engineering`](../javascript-typescript-engineering/SKILL.md),
[`python-engineering`](../python-engineering/SKILL.md), or
[`rust-async-web`](../rust-async-web/SKILL.md) for language/framework mechanics;
add this skill only when styling choices or style build behavior matter. Use
[`ux-accessibility-review`](../ux-accessibility-review/SKILL.md) as primary for a
rendered-interface accessibility or UX audit; use this skill to implement or
review the underlying stylesheet behavior.

## Workflow

1. Detect the existing styling system before editing. Look at file patterns,
   imports, build scripts, framework config, README, design docs, Storybook or
   component examples, screenshots, and browser/E2E tests.
2. Identify the ownership boundary: global reset/theme, design tokens, component
   module, utility classes, template-level styles, generated CSS, or framework
   asset pipeline.
3. Preserve the established styling system unless the task explicitly calls for
   adoption or migration. In a repository without one, choose plain CSS unless
   Tailwind or SCSS provides clear, evidence-backed value; do not introduce a
   framework or preprocessor for one isolated change.
4. Make the smallest style change that preserves existing naming, cascade,
   token, breakpoint, and build conventions.
5. Verify both the source and output: formatter/linter, SCSS compilation when
   applicable, app build, targeted UI/browser tests, and a manual or screenshot
   check when layout/visual behavior is the product.

## Detect The Styling System

Use multiple clues; one dependency or file name is not enough.

| Surface | Clues |
| --- | --- |
| Plain CSS | `.css`, `styles.css`, `app.css`, `globals.css`, `assets/css/`, `<link rel="stylesheet">`, JS/TS imports of `.css`, no Sass dependency or loader. |
| SCSS/Sass | `.scss`, `.sass`, `_partial.scss`, `@use`, `@forward`, `$variables`, `@mixin`, `@include`, `sass` or `sass-embedded` dependencies, `sass-loader`, `vite`/`webpack`/`esbuild` Sass config, `sass` CLI scripts. |
| CSS modules | `*.module.css`, `*.module.scss`, imports such as `import styles from "./Button.module.css"`, generated scoped class names. |
| CSS-in-JS | `styled-components`, `@emotion/*`, `vanilla-extract`, `stitches`, `linaria`, `stylex`, `css\`...\``, `styled.div`, extracted CSS build plugins. |
| Tailwind CSS | `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`, or `@tailwindcss/cli` dependencies; `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@theme`, or `@source`; legacy `tailwind.config.*` or `@tailwind` directives; PostCSS/Vite/framework integration; utility class strings in templates/components. |
| Other utility CSS | UnoCSS/Windi dependencies or config, utility presets, generated utility entrypoints, and dense utility class strings in templates/components. |
| Framework conventions | Next/Vite/Astro/Svelte/Vue/Angular style entrypoints, Django/Flask static folders and templates, Rails-style asset folders, Leptos/Trunk/cargo-leptos static assets, Axum static-file routes. |

When conventions conflict, follow the closest local owner. For example, a React
app may use global CSS for tokens, CSS modules for components, and utility
classes for layout; do not collapse those into one system unless the task is an
explicit migration.

For Tailwind, determine the installed major version from the manifest and
lockfile, then corroborate it with the stylesheet entrypoint, framework plugin,
and configuration. Do not infer a version from one directive or copy syntax from
a different major. Consult the installed version's official setup,
configuration, source-detection, migration, and compatibility guidance.

## Tailwind CSS Decision Rules

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first styling framework and build workflow. Authors
compose small presentational classes, including responsive and state variants,
in markup or components; Tailwind scans configured source files for recognizable
class tokens and emits the corresponding CSS. It is not a replacement for the
CSS language: its output is CSS, and custom CSS remains appropriate where
utilities are not the clearest or safest expression.

Choose the primary authoring approach from repository evidence and the change's
ownership boundary:

| Prefer | When and why |
| --- | --- |
| Tailwind | The repository already uses it and the change fits its tokens, variants, component conventions, and build pipeline; or an explicit adoption has a bounded UI scope, stable source scanning, compatible browser targets, and a team preference for composing styles in markup. It is especially useful for token-constrained product UI, repeated responsive/state variants, and component/template systems that own their class strings. |
| Plain CSS | The repository already uses CSS; the change is small or global; selectors must target editorial, generated, third-party, or otherwise uncontrolled markup; the style depends on complex cascade/selectors or highly dynamic values; or adding a scan/build framework would create a second styling system. CSS is also preferable for portable framework-neutral output and runtime custom-property theming. |
| SCSS | The repository already has Sass and the problem benefits materially from compile-time maps, mixins, functions, or generated rules; or adopting Tailwind would add more migration and build risk than it removes. Confirm the exact Tailwind/Sass compatibility before combining toolchains: current Tailwind v4 is not designed to be used with Sass, Less, or Stylus. |
| Intentional hybrid | The repository already separates responsibilities clearly, such as Tailwind for component composition and plain CSS for base styles, rich content, third-party markup, or bespoke selectors. Keep a single owner for each token and component; a hybrid is not permission to duplicate every rule in both systems. |

Do not introduce Tailwind when:

- The request is an isolated style change in a project with a working CSS, SCSS,
  CSS-module, or CSS-in-JS system.
- The project cannot reliably scan all class-bearing source files, generated
  templates, shared packages, or runtime content.
- The supported browsers, build environment, deployment model, or content
  security constraints are incompatible with the installed major's documented
  requirements.
- Most styling targets markup the project does not control, or the design is
  deliberately bespoke and would depend heavily on arbitrary values and custom
  plugins.
- Adoption would require a broad rewrite, reset/cascade change, or new token
  system that the task did not authorize.

When Tailwind is appropriate:

1. Use the repository's package manager and framework integration for the exact
   installed major. Preserve the existing stylesheet entrypoint, plugin order,
   generated-output policy, and development/build commands.
2. Keep candidate class names complete and statically recognizable in source.
   Map props or variants to complete class strings instead of constructing
   fragments such as `bg-${color}-500`. Use a documented source-registration or
   safelist mechanism only for genuinely external or generated inputs, not to
   hide an unbounded dynamic-class design.
3. Use the version-appropriate theme/configuration surface for shared design
   tokens. In v4 that includes `@theme`; use ordinary CSS custom properties when
   a value should exist at runtime without creating a utility API. Promote
   repeated arbitrary values into named tokens or custom utilities.
4. Keep responsive, dark-mode, motion, pointer, focus-visible, disabled, and
   other state variants consistent with local conventions and accessibility
   requirements. Do not encode behavior-critical state only through color or
   motion.
5. Extract repeated markup into the repository's components, templates, or
   partials before inventing a parallel semantic class layer. Write custom CSS
   for complex selectors, uncontrolled rich content, or a clearer bounded
   abstraction. Use `@apply` only when local conventions and the installed
   version support it; do not use it merely to recreate every utility string as
   a semantic class.
6. Review Tailwind's base-style/reset behavior, including Preflight when present,
   before adoption or upgrades. Check form controls, headings, lists, media,
   borders, third-party widgets, and application base styles for changed browser
   defaults.
7. Verify the production build, generated CSS, source detection for every
   package/template boundary, browser-visible states, accessibility behavior,
   and output size. A source-string assertion or successful formatter is not
   proof that the required utility was generated or renders correctly.

## CSS Versus SCSS Decision Rules

CSS is the browser's stylesheet language. Use it directly when the project can
express the style with the platform: custom properties, cascade layers, media
queries, container queries, logical properties, Grid/Flexbox, modern selectors,
and native nesting where the target browsers or build pipeline support it.

SCSS is the CSS-like syntax for Sass, a preprocessor that compiles to CSS. Sass
also has the indented `.sass` syntax; do not introduce `.sass` unless the
repository already uses it. Prefer `.scss` for new Sass work because it is close
to CSS and easier to migrate incrementally.

Prefer **plain CSS** when:

- The project already uses CSS and modern CSS features solve the problem.
- The only desired SCSS feature is shallow nesting, variables, or simple file
  organization that CSS custom properties, native nesting, `@layer`, and imports
  or bundler entrypoints already cover.
- Runtime theming, user preferences, dark mode, container-size changes, or
  JavaScript-adjusted tokens need CSS custom properties in the browser.
- The project has no Sass build path and adding one would expand dependencies,
  CI time, editor setup, or deployment risk.

Prefer **SCSS** when:

- The repository already uses Sass and the change fits its module/token/mixin
  structure.
- Compile-time composition materially reduces duplication: shared maps, generated
  variants, math, functions, mixins, partials, or a package-style stylesheet API.
- A design system has many related tokens that need compile-time validation or
  exports through `@use`/`@forward`.
- A legacy SCSS codebase needs cleanup, migration from `@import`, or safer
  modularization without changing the browser-facing CSS contract.

If the decision is not obvious, state the tradeoff and choose the option that
adds less toolchain and migration burden.

## Modern CSS Guidance

- Use custom properties (`--token`) for runtime theme values, component-local
  tokens, dark/light modes, user preferences, and values JavaScript or media
  queries may change. Keep fallback values deliberate.
- Use cascade layers (`@layer reset, base, components, utilities;`) to make
  precedence explicit for resets, tokens, components, and overrides. Do not use
  specificity wars as a layer substitute.
- Use container queries for components that respond to their container, not the
  viewport. Keep media queries for viewport, device, and user-preference concerns
  such as `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-color-scheme`, or coarse pointers.
- Use logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-block`, `inset-inline`,
  `border-start-start-radius`) when layout should survive writing-mode or
  direction changes.
- Use Flexbox for one-dimensional alignment and Grid for two-dimensional layout.
  Avoid float/table layout except for true legacy constraints.
- Use native CSS nesting only when local browser support or the build pipeline
  supports it; keep nesting shallow and avoid hiding selector specificity.
- Represent design tokens close to their consumption: global primitives on
  `:root`, semantic tokens in theme scopes, and component tokens on component
  roots. Avoid magic numbers unless the value is truly one-off.
- Prefer semantic class names and component boundaries over selectors coupled to
  deep DOM structure.

## Modern SCSS Guidance

- Use the Sass module system. Prefer `@use` for consuming variables, mixins, and
  functions, and `@forward` for exposing a curated module API. Avoid adding new
  `@import`; current Sass treats it as deprecated and it will be removed in a
  future major Dart Sass release.
- Keep module members namespaced (`theme.$space-2`, `@include buttons.reset`) so
  origins stay clear. Use `as *` only for a small, intentional compatibility
  layer.
- Use `$variables` for compile-time constants and CSS custom properties for
  runtime theming. Do not replace runtime `var(--token)` values with Sass
  variables unless the value never changes in the browser.
- Use mixins for repeated declaration groups that need parameters or feature
  gates. Avoid mixins that hide large, unrelated blocks of CSS.
- Use functions for pure value calculations. Keep side effects and emitted CSS in
  mixins, not functions.
- Use maps for related token sets and generated variants; validate expected keys
  where the project has patterns for doing so.
- Use partials (`_tokens.scss`) for files loaded by modules. Keep entrypoints
  explicit (`app.scss`, `index.scss`) and avoid accidental emitted CSS from helper
  files unless the module is meant to emit it.
- Use interpolation (`#{$name}`) sparingly for generated selectors, custom
  property names, or asset paths. Avoid interpolation that makes selector search
  and refactoring unreliable.
- Treat Sass as a build dependency. Update scripts, bundler config, Docker/CI, and
  generated output policy when introducing it.

## Integration Patterns

- **HTML pages:** link compiled CSS through `<link rel="stylesheet">` in the
  intended order. Keep critical inline styles minimal and avoid duplicating large
  rules across pages.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript apps:** use existing bundler conventions for CSS
  imports, CSS modules, extracted CSS, PostCSS, or CSS-in-JS. Load
  [`javascript-typescript-engineering`](../javascript-typescript-engineering/SKILL.md)
  when package scripts, lockfiles, Vite/Webpack/Next/etc. config, or TypeScript
  component code changes.
- **Python web apps:** keep templates responsible for markup and class hooks;
  serve styles through the framework's static asset path such as Django static
  files or Flask `url_for("static", ...)`. Load
  [`python-engineering`](../python-engineering/SKILL.md) when routes, templates,
  packaging, or framework config changes.
- **Rust Leptos/Axum apps:** keep Leptos components deterministic for SSR and
  hydration, use class/style bindings only where they produce stable markup, and
  serve compiled assets through the app's Trunk/cargo-leptos/Axum static route.
  Load [`rust-async-web`](../rust-async-web/SKILL.md) when server functions,
  hydration, routing, WASM targets, or Axum static-file behavior changes.
- **Tailwind and other utility CSS:** apply the decision and source-detection
  rules above, then follow the local framework, version, entrypoint, token, and
  component conventions. Do not replace established utilities with handcrafted
  CSS, or vice versa, without an explicit migration goal.
- **CSS-in-JS:** follow the existing extraction/runtime model. Keep dynamic values
  bounded, avoid per-render stylesheet churn, and verify SSR/hydration behavior
  when styles are generated server-side.

## Accessibility, Responsive Design, And Performance

- Preserve visible focus states, hover/focus/active/disabled distinctions,
  contrast, text resizing, zoom, reduced-motion preferences, and hit-target sizes.
- Responsive behavior should come from fluid layout, intrinsic sizing, container
  queries, and minimal breakpoints before adding many viewport-specific overrides.
- Use `rem`, `em`, percentages, viewport/container units, and logical properties
  where they preserve user settings and layout direction.
- Keep animations cheap and optional: prefer transform/opacity, avoid layout
  thrash, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Avoid loading unused CSS. Check code splitting, extraction, purging/content
  scanning, and critical CSS only within the project's existing build model.
- Check browser compatibility against the project's stated support matrix,
  Browserslist, framework baseline, or test browsers. Consult current official
  documentation for version-sensitive Tailwind, framework, Sass, or build-tool
  behavior.

## Safe Tailwind Adoption Or Migration

1. Require an explicit adoption or migration goal. Record why Tailwind is a
   better fit than extending the existing CSS/SCSS system, which UI boundary is
   in scope, and what remains out of scope.
2. Inventory stylesheet entrypoints, tokens, resets/base styles, cascade order,
   source roots, shared packages, generated templates, class-name consumers,
   browser targets, tests, and generated-asset/deployment policy.
3. Add or upgrade Tailwind through the repository's normal dependency workflow
   and the official instructions for the exact major and framework. Do not
   hand-edit lockfiles or assume configuration from another major.
4. Prove the pipeline on a bounded representative slice. Preserve one styling
   owner per component and token, and avoid a long-lived state where equivalent
   CSS and utilities compete for the same elements.
5. Review Preflight/base-style and cascade effects separately from component
   conversion. Keep rollback possible by isolating entrypoint and configuration
   changes from later mechanical migrations.
6. Validate development and production builds, source detection across package
   boundaries, generated output and size, visual/browser states, accessibility,
   and deployment/cache behavior before expanding the migration.

## Safe CSS-To-SCSS Migration

1. Confirm a migration is justified. If modern CSS solves the need, keep CSS and
   document why no preprocessor was added.
2. Inventory entrypoints, imports, static references, test snapshots, generated
   assets, cache keys, and deployment paths.
3. Add Sass through the repository's package/build workflow; do not hand-edit
   lockfiles or generated bundles.
4. Rename incrementally (`.css` to `.scss`) and keep CSS-compatible syntax first.
   Update imports, HTML links, template references, and build scripts together.
5. Introduce SCSS features only after compilation matches the old output closely
   enough to review. Prefer `@use`/`@forward` modules over `@import`.
6. Validate compiled CSS, app build, visual or browser tests, accessibility states,
   and cache/deploy behavior. Compare output size and selector changes when risk
   is high.

Migration risks include broken asset URLs, changed cascade order, duplicated or
missing emitted CSS, CSS module class-name changes, source-map drift, framework
watcher failures, CI image missing Sass, and visual regressions hidden by broad
snapshots.

## Anti-Patterns

- Introducing Tailwind for one component or isolated fix in a repository with
  an established styling system.
- Running Tailwind and CSS/SCSS as overlapping systems without explicit ownership
  or a bounded migration plan.
- Mixing configuration, directives, plugins, or migration advice from different
  Tailwind major versions; or combining current Tailwind v4 with Sass, Less, or
  Stylus without contrary evidence from the installed version's official docs.
- Constructing utility class fragments dynamically, then using a broad safelist
  as a substitute for finite mappings to complete class strings.
- Accumulating arbitrary values, global `!important`, or one-off plugins instead
  of extending shared tokens and resolving the actual cascade boundary.
- Rebuilding every utility string with `@apply`, or using utilities in isolated
  CSS modules/component style blocks without the installed version's required
  reference/build context.
- Ignoring Preflight or other base-style effects on existing elements and
  third-party widgets.
- Converting to SCSS by default when CSS custom properties, `@layer`, native
  nesting, or container queries are enough.
- Adding `@import` to new Sass code instead of `@use`/`@forward`.
- Using Sass variables for values that must change at runtime in the browser.
- Deep nesting that hides specificity and makes overrides brittle.
- Global selectors, resets, or utility overrides that leak outside their intended
  layer or component boundary.
- Copying class strings, breakpoints, colors, or z-index values instead of using
  existing tokens and conventions.
- Hiding behavior-critical state only in color or motion without accessible text,
  focus, or reduced-motion alternatives.
- Treating formatter/linter success as proof that layout, cascade, accessibility,
  or browser compatibility is correct.

## Security And Evidence

Load [`security-review`](../security-review/SKILL.md) when styling work touches
CSP, external fonts/assets, user-generated HTML/CSS, template rendering, Markdown
or rich-text styling, inline styles with untrusted values, URL-valued CSS,
uploaded assets, or SSR injection paths. Use
[`security-review-evidence`](../security-review-evidence/SKILL.md) when reports
include screenshots, DOM excerpts, network traces, tokens, private URLs, or other
sensitive evidence.

## Successful Use

The final handoff states the styling system and installed Tailwind major detected,
the Tailwind-vs-CSS-vs-SCSS decision, files changed, build/tooling and source-scan
impact, validation commands run, visual or browser checks performed, and
remaining cascade/reset, browser, accessibility, and performance risk. Omit
Tailwind-specific details when Tailwind is not part of the task.
