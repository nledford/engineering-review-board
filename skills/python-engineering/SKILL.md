# Python Engineering

Use this skill for project-neutral Python implementation, review, tests,
packaging, dependency management, and quality gates. Prefer repository recipes
when they encode the supported Python version, `uv` workflow, test services, or
CI policy.

## Use When

- Editing `.py` files, Python package layout, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`,
  requirements files, tests, type-checker config, Ruff config, or build metadata.
- Adding behavior, fixing bugs, refactoring Python modules, reviewing Python
  code, or modernizing package/dependency workflows.
- Working with `uv`, pytest, unittest, Ruff, mypy, Pyright, packaging, or Python
  CLIs.

Do not use this skill for non-Python package managers, browser E2E test design,
or database-native design except where Python code owns the adapter boundary.
Use [`sqlite-sql-engineering`](../sqlite-sql-engineering/SKILL.md) or
[`postgresql-sql-engineering`](../postgresql-sql-engineering/SKILL.md) for
schema, transaction, query-plan, and database-specific behavior.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the local project first: `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`,
   `.python-version`, `requirements*.txt`, `tox.ini`, `noxfile.py`, CI, README,
   tests, package layout, and existing commands.
2. Define the behavior before editing. Use TDD for new behavior and regressions;
   use BDD-style examples for externally observable workflows.
3. Keep boundaries clear. Use DDD language where domain rules matter; keep I/O,
   framework, database, and CLI parsing at adapters instead of leaking into core
   domain logic.
4. Implement small, typed, testable units. Prefer simple functions/classes,
   explicit data models, narrow exceptions, and dependency injection at
   boundaries over global state and broad mocks.
5. Run a narrow feedback loop first, then broaden to the repository's quality
   gate.

## uv And Packaging

- Use `uv` project commands when the repo has `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
  Use legacy `uv pip ...` only when the project is intentionally
  requirements-driven.
- Keep dependency changes intentional: add runtime dependencies with `uv add`,
  dev/test dependencies with the repo's configured dependency group, and remove
  unused packages with the corresponding `uv remove`.
- Keep lockfiles reproducible. Do not edit `uv.lock` by hand.
- Use `uv run` for project commands so the environment and lockfile are
  respected.
- For distributable packages, ensure `pyproject.toml` has an appropriate
  `[build-system]`, package metadata, and importable package layout before
  relying on builds.

Useful commands:

```sh
uv sync
uv sync --locked
uv lock
uv lock --check
uv add <package>
uv add --dev <package>
uv remove <package>
uv run python -m pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy .
uv run pyright
uv build
```

Adapt type-check and test commands to the tools actually configured.

## Python Design Checklist

- Public functions and methods have meaningful parameter and return types.
  Avoid `Any` unless the boundary is genuinely untyped and the reason is clear.
- Use built-in generics and unions (`list[T]`, `dict[K, V]`, `T | None`) when
  supported by the repo's Python version.
- Use dataclasses, `TypedDict`, protocols, enums, or small value objects when
  they clarify data shape or domain invariants.
- Exceptions are specific, preserve cause with `raise ... from exc`, and carry
  enough context for diagnosis without leaking secrets.
- Async code uses non-blocking libraries, awaits coroutines, manages async
  context managers with `async with`, and avoids blocking file/network/sleep
  calls in the event loop.
- Module names and package boundaries follow cohesive behavior, not arbitrary
  utility buckets.
- Avoid mutable defaults, hidden import-time side effects, implicit global
  configuration, broad monkeypatching, and print-based observability in
  application code.

## Testing Guidance

- Unit tests cover pure domain logic, validation, parsing, error mapping, and
  edge cases.
- Integration tests cover filesystems, databases, services, framework wiring,
  subprocesses, and package/CLI behavior.
- Use pytest fixtures for shared setup with explicit cleanup; keep mutable
  fixtures function-scoped unless sharing is intentional and safe.
- Parametrize real behavior variants instead of duplicating similar tests.
- Mock external boundaries, not the domain logic being specified. Patch where
  the symbol is used, use `AsyncMock` for awaited collaborators, and verify
  important calls.
- Async tests must use the configured async test plugin or framework support and
  await all async work.
- Regression tests should fail on the old bug for the expected reason before the
  fix.

## Review Checklist

- Correctness: behavior matches the request, edge cases are handled, exceptions
  are specific, and resource cleanup is reliable.
- Typing and API: type hints describe the contract, optional values are handled,
  public APIs are stable enough, and data shapes are explicit.
- Maintainability: modules have cohesive ownership, names use domain language,
  abstractions remove real duplication, and refactors preserve behavior.
- Performance: hot paths avoid accidental O(n^2) work, repeated I/O, import-time
  cost, unnecessary serialization, and blocking work in async contexts.
- Security: input is validated at trust boundaries, secrets are not logged,
  subprocesses and paths are safe, and dependency changes are reviewed.
- Tests: new behavior has unit or integration coverage at the narrowest useful
  level, and broad mocks do not make tests meaningless.
- Workflow: `pyproject.toml`, lockfiles, format/lint/type/test commands, docs,
  and CI remain synchronized.

## Anti-Patterns

- Running tools outside the project environment and then reporting confidence.
- Replacing domain behavior with mocks.
- Catching `Exception` broadly without a recovery policy and context.
- Adding dependencies for trivial standard-library behavior.
- Treating formatting, linting, type checking, and tests as interchangeable.
- Shipping Python package changes without checking lockfile and build metadata.

## Successful Use

The final handoff states the behavior changed, tests or quality gates run, lock
or packaging changes made, and residual risk if type checks, tests, or builds
could not run.
