# Code Review

Use this skill to review repository changes for correctness, maintainability,
security, reliability, domain integrity, test quality, and operational fit. A
review is not a style pass; report only issues with evidence and impact.

Before reporting findings, apply
[`review-verification-protocol`](../review-verification-protocol/SKILL.md).
Load specialist skills only when they match the changed surface. For Rust code,
pair this skill with [`rust-code-review`](../rust-code-review/SKILL.md).

## Use When

- The user asks for a review, audit, PR review, risk pass, or final check.
- You made meaningful repository changes and need a focused review before
  handoff.
- The diff touches production behavior, public interfaces, data contracts,
  architecture, tests, security, dependencies, build, CI, release, docs, or agent
  instructions.
- A prior review needs re-checking after fixes.

## Skip Only When

Skip review only for changes that are clearly low risk, such as typo-only,
formatting-only, or generated mechanical updates with no behavior, workflow,
security, contract, or instruction impact. If skipped, say why and still report
the validation that ran.

Never skip review for security-sensitive work, API/schema changes, domain model
changes, test weakening, dependency/toolchain changes, CI changes, or work where
impact is uncertain.

## Review Workflow

1. **Understand intent.**
   - Identify the request, issue, acceptance criteria, regression, or plan step.
   - Separate intended behavior from implementation choices.

2. **Map affected surfaces.**
   - Name touched modules, domain concepts, public APIs, storage, workflows,
     generated artifacts, docs, commands, CI, and security boundaries.

3. **Choose lenses.**
   - Use this general review lens first.
   - Add narrow specialist skills for Rust, PostgreSQL/SQLite/SQL, Python, Bun,
     browser tests, security evidence, Justfiles, or other surfaces only when
     they apply.

4. **Review tests and behavior.**
   - Check whether tests or examples specify observable behavior and meaningful
     edge cases.
   - Confirm tests are not brittle implementation snapshots unless the
     implementation detail is the contract.

5. **Review implementation.**
   - Verify the change satisfies intent, preserves invariants, keeps
     responsibilities in the right place, and avoids avoidable coupling.

6. **Review failure modes.**
   - Check validation, authorization, error mapping, retries, cleanup,
     cancellation, transactions, resource limits, logging, metrics, and rollback
     where relevant.

7. **Review contracts and operations.**
   - Check docs, recipes, environment examples, generated artifacts, migrations,
     CI, release surfaces, and runbooks when changed behavior affects operators,
     developers, users, or agents.

8. **Confirm validation.**
   - Required checks should pass, or failures must be clearly unrelated,
     environmental, pre-existing, or intentionally out of scope.

9. **Report verified findings only.**
   - Omit speculation and style preferences.
   - Downgrade uncertain issues to questions when evidence is incomplete.

## BDD, DDD, and TDD Lenses

- **BDD:** User-visible behavior should be described as observable outcomes,
  scenarios, acceptance criteria, or behavior-oriented tests.
- **DDD:** Domain names, boundaries, responsibilities, policies, and invariants
  should match the repository language and avoid leaking infrastructure inward.
- **TDD:** New behavior and bug fixes should have meaningful tests where
  practical. Refactors should preserve behavior through existing or added safety
  nets.

## Finding Severity

- **Blocking:** Must be fixed before merge or handoff: security vulnerability,
  data corruption, compile failure, broken required checks, severe regression, or
  unsupported public contract break.
- **High:** Significant correctness, security, reliability, maintainability,
  architectural, domain, persistence, or serialization risk.
- **Medium:** Meaningful edge-case gap, weak test for important behavior,
  unclear contract, avoidable coupling, missing changed-behavior docs, or
  operational drift.
- **Low:** Local clarity, minor docs/test improvement, or low-risk cleanup.
- **Question:** A narrow clarification is needed before judging acceptability.
- **Praise:** Optional, specific positive feedback worth preserving.

## Finding Format

Put findings first, ordered by severity:

```text
[Severity] path/to/file.ext:123 - Short issue title
Problem: What is wrong, tied to the affected behavior or code.
Why it matters: Concrete correctness, domain, security, test, workflow, or
maintainability impact.
Recommended fix: Specific next step.
Evidence: File/line, command output, search result, or verified absence.
```

If there are no verified findings, say so directly and name the review scope,
validation performed, and residual risks.

## Review Checklist

- Correctness and observable behavior match the request.
- Domain names, boundaries, ownership, and invariants remain clear.
- Tests cover the important success path, failure path, edge case, or regression.
- Public APIs, schemas, serialization, docs, and generated contracts are
  deliberate and synchronized.
- Error handling, retries, cleanup, transactions, cancellation, and resource
  limits fit the affected workflow.
- Security and privacy boundaries are preserved and evidence is sanitized.
- Performance, scalability, concurrency, and resource usage are acceptable for
  the touched path.
- Logs, metrics, traces, and user/operator messages are useful without exposing
  secrets.
- Documentation, recipes, CI, release, and agent guidance match changed behavior.
- Formatting, linting, type checking, tests, and required validation are clean or
  accurately reported.

## Reporting Rules

- Lead with findings. Keep summaries secondary.
- Do not report unverified speculation, taste preferences, or unrelated future
  work as defects.
- Do not ask for broad rewrites when a targeted fix addresses the issue.
- For security-sensitive findings, follow repository policy and avoid exposing
  secrets, private paths, raw tokens, cookies, credentialed URLs, or sensitive
  payloads.
- For re-reviews, verify previous fixes only unless the user asks for a fresh
  full review.
