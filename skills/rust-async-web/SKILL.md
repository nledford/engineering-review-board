# Rust Async And Web

Use this skill for async Rust services and full-stack Rust applications. Keep
runtime, HTTP, UI, and persistence boundaries explicit so domain logic remains
testable without the framework. Use
[`hexagonal-architecture`](../hexagonal-architecture/SKILL.md) when handlers,
jobs, server functions, message consumers, persistence, or external clients need
formal ports/adapters or shared application use cases.

Do not use this skill for API-contract-only work such as endpoint/resource
shape, request/response/error envelopes, versioning, pagination, idempotency, or
OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/protobuf artifacts; use [`api-design`](../api-design/SKILL.md)
for those contracts. Do not use it for observability-only work such as
log/metric/trace schemas, context-propagation standards, labels/cardinality,
dashboards, alerts, SLOs, or telemetry sampling; use
[`observability-engineering`](../observability-engineering/SKILL.md). Add this
skill only when the task also changes Tokio, Axum, Leptos, SSR, hydration, WASM,
task, or runtime behavior.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the runtime and stack: `Cargo.toml` features, `tokio` runtime setup,
   Axum routers, Leptos app/hydration configuration, server functions, WASM
   build target, stylesheet/static asset pipeline, middleware, tracing, and
   existing test recipes.
2. Define externally observable behavior with BDD-style acceptance criteria.
   Keep domain invariants in framework-independent types where practical.
3. Design task ownership, cancellation, timeouts, backpressure, shared state,
   and error propagation before adding handlers or components.
4. Implement narrow vertical slices: domain logic, adapter/handler/server
   function, UI or response behavior, and tests.
5. Verify the server side, client/WASM side, and hydration/SSR behavior with the
   repository's commands.

## Security Review Prompts

Load [`security-review`](../security-review/SKILL.md) when async/web work
touches auth, authorization, sessions or cookies, CORS/CSRF/CSP, redirects,
SSR/hydration trust boundaries, server functions, uploads/downloads, path
handling, request/response redaction, secrets, external-service calls,
telemetry that may leak sensitive data, or artifact handling. Use
[`threat-modeling`](../threat-modeling/SKILL.md) before or during new auth
middleware, request/SSR/server-function boundaries, background workers, queues,
webhooks, external-service integrations, or sensitive data flows. Use
[`dependency-supply-chain-review`](../dependency-supply-chain-review/SKILL.md)
when Tokio/Axum/Leptos or toolchain dependency changes, generated assets, CI
bootstrap, installers, or binaries raise provenance or advisory questions. Pair
security-sensitive reviews with
[`security-review-evidence`](../security-review-evidence/SKILL.md) when evidence
includes sanitized HTTP traces, logs/spans, browser or server-function payloads,
screenshots, generated assets, or test artifacts.

## When To Choose Async Rust

- Use async deliberately for I/O-bound or high-concurrency work: network
  servers and clients, database calls, queues, workers, orchestration layers,
  file or process I/O with async APIs, and fan-out/fan-in workflows.
- Do not make code async by default. Synchronous Rust is usually clearer for
  CPU-bound algorithms, pure domain logic, simple CLIs, low-concurrency tools,
  and code where blocking APIs are sufficient.
- Async changes API shape. It affects trait boundaries, dependency injection,
  lifetimes, `Send + 'static` requirements for spawned work, cancellation,
  error propagation, and which tests need a runtime.
- Keep blocking libraries behind explicit boundaries. In an async service, wrap
  unavoidable blocking or CPU-heavy work with `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, a
  dedicated thread pool, or a separate worker process instead of blocking Tokio
  runtime threads.
- Distinguish concurrency from parallelism. Async lets many tasks wait on I/O;
  it does not make CPU-heavy work faster unless that work is moved to real
  parallel execution.

## Architecture Boundaries

- Keep domain logic pure, deterministic, and preferably synchronous. Avoid
  leaking Tokio types, channels, timers, task handles, database pools, request
  types, or framework state into the domain model.
- Put async I/O at application, infrastructure, adapter, or port boundaries.
  Application services/use cases may orchestrate async repositories, clients,
  queues, clocks, and external services while domain objects enforce rules.
- Use ports/traits for async dependencies only where the boundary earns it:
  repositories, external clients, queues, clocks, id generators, and background
  job interfaces. Do not force async into every layer because one adapter is
  async.
- Keep Tokio-specific details in infrastructure adapters and process wiring:
  runtime flavor, channels, task spawning, cancellation tokens, signal handling,
  tracing setup, and adapter-specific retry/timeout policy.
- For async traits, prefer the simplest option the repository supports. Native
  `async fn` in traits can work for static dispatch when the MSRV and auto-trait
  bounds fit; use explicit future return types, boxed futures, or `async-trait`
  when object safety, dyn dispatch, or tighter `Send` control matters.
- Use BDD examples at the system, inbound adapter, or use-case boundary; TDD
  domain rules with sync unit tests; test async application services with fakes;
  and test real adapters with `#[tokio::test]` integration tests.

## Tokio Runtime, Coordination, And Cancellation

Use the [Tokio runtime reference](references/tokio-runtime.md) when the task
requires runtime construction, spawning, coordination primitives, cancellation,
or graceful shutdown. Keep the core constraints visible: never block runtime
threads, give every task an owner and shutdown path, bound concurrency and
queues, and treat cancellation as real control flow.

## Axum

- Keep routers, handlers, extractors, state, and middleware thin. Move domain
  decisions into services or domain modules that can be tested without HTTP.
- Use typed extractors for inputs and `State`/substates for application state.
  Store shared state in `Arc` when it must be cloned into handlers.
- Convert domain and adapter errors into HTTP responses at the edge. Avoid
  leaking database, framework, or internal error details to clients. Use
  [`api-design`](../api-design/SKILL.md) when status codes, error envelopes,
  route shapes, or request/response payloads are contract decisions.
- Validate payload size, content type, authentication, authorization, and input
  shape before invoking domain behavior.
- Prefer Tower middleware or extractors for cross-cutting HTTP concerns such as
  tracing, auth, timeouts, compression, and request ids.
- Tests should cover handler behavior through routers where HTTP semantics
  matter and through pure functions where they do not.

## Leptos And Axum-Leptos

- Decide whether behavior belongs in CSR, SSR, server functions, actions,
  resources, or ordinary backend routes. Keep security-sensitive work on the
  server.
- Server functions are trust boundaries. Validate input, authorization, and
  idempotency server-side even when the client UI already checks them.
- Components should keep state derivation clear. Avoid burying domain rules in
  signal plumbing when a normal Rust function or type can own the rule.
- SSR and hydration must render compatible markup. Avoid browser-only APIs,
  nondeterministic values, or time-dependent output during server rendering
  unless guarded for the target.
- WASM code should avoid unavailable server APIs and large unnecessary
  dependencies. Check crate features and target-specific modules.
- Axum-Leptos integrations should keep router state, server function context,
  static assets, fallback handling, and error pages explicit.

### Leptos-Use

- Consult the current [Leptos-Use documentation](https://leptos-use.rs/) and the
  repository's pinned Leptos and `leptos-use` versions before using an API.
  Consider the crate before hand-writing reusable reactive wrappers for browser
  events, media queries and preferences, storage, observers, timers, sensors,
  streams, or other Web APIs. Prefer native Leptos or direct `web-sys` code when
  the behavior is small, unsupported, or clearer without another abstraction.
- Inspect each function's documented SSR behavior; server fallbacks vary by
  utility. Use SSR-safe targets such as `use_window()` and `use_document()`
  instead of accessing browser globals during server rendering, and verify that
  fallback values cannot produce incorrect initial markup or hydration mismatches.
- In an SSR application, enable `leptos-use/ssr` through the application's
  server-only feature, not globally on the dependency. Inspect function-level
  crate features and avoid shipping unused defaults when WASM size or compile
  time matters, while preserving the repository's established feature policy.
- Prefer utilities that bind cleanup to the Leptos owner for listeners,
  observers, timers, and streams. Retain and call returned cleanup, pause, stop,
  or close controls when behavior must end before owner cleanup; confirm any
  same-thread restrictions in the selected API's documentation.
- Treat local/session storage as user-visible, origin-scoped client state, not
  trusted or secret storage. Account for decoding failures, unavailable storage,
  cross-tab updates, and hydration timing. For permissions and sensors, handle
  unsupported, denied, unavailable, and paused states rather than assuming a
  successful browser API call.

Load [`css-scss-styling`](../css-scss-styling/SKILL.md) when Leptos/Axum work
touches `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, stylesheet entrypoints, Trunk/cargo-leptos
style assets, class/style bindings, design tokens, responsive layout, CSS
modules, or browser-visible cascade behavior. Keep this skill focused on Rust
runtime, SSR, hydration, server functions, routing, and WASM constraints.

## Commands

Prefer repository scripts for full-stack apps because they often manage CSS,
WASM, assets, environment, and services. Useful direct checks include:

```sh
cargo check -p <server-package> --all-targets
cargo check -p <client-package> --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo test -p <package>
cargo clippy -p <package> --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

For final confidence, run the repository's broader Rust, browser, and service
tests when the change affects hydrated UI, routing, server functions, or HTTP
behavior.

## Common Pitfalls

- Introducing async where synchronous code is simpler and sufficient.
- Coupling domain models, value objects, or invariants to Tokio types.
- Confusing async concurrency with CPU parallelism.
- Creating nested runtimes instead of keeping the runtime at process edges.
- Detached tasks that hide panics, ignore shutdown, or continue using stale
  state after a request is gone.
- Ignoring `JoinHandle` results or losing task errors.
- Missing cancellation paths for background workers, request fan-out, or
  long-running orchestration.
- Blocking the async runtime with sync I/O, CPU-heavy work, thread sleeps, or
  long critical sections.
- Holding locks, transactions, or borrowed request data across unrelated awaits.
- Unbounded channels or queues that turn overload into memory growth.
- Mixing blocking and async I/O without an explicit adapter or `spawn_blocking`
  boundary.
- Surprising `Send + 'static` requirements from `tokio::spawn` after borrowing
  request-local data.
- Hiding async trait allocation, object-safety, or `Send` tradeoffs behind a port
  abstraction without documenting the reason.
- Mapping every error to `500` or every auth failure to the same response without
  preserving observability.
- Calling SQL or external services directly from UI components instead of a
  server-side boundary.
- Hydration mismatches caused by random ids, current time, locale, feature
  differences, or browser-only APIs during SSR.
- Sharing mutable state because it is convenient rather than because the domain
  requires shared mutation.

## Review Checklist

- Async work has bounded lifetime, cancellation, timeout, and backpressure.
- Handler/component/server-function boundaries are thin and testable.
- Domain invariants are not duplicated across UI, HTTP, and persistence layers.
- Errors are actionable internally and safe externally.
- Shared state and locks cannot deadlock, block the runtime, or leak across
  unrelated requests.
- Server-rendered and client-hydrated output agree for the changed behavior.
- Tests cover the behavior at the lowest useful layer plus at least one
  framework boundary when routing, extraction, hydration, or server functions
  are part of the change.
