## Durable implementation-plan workflow

Use canonical plans at
`docs/implementation-plans/plans/<series>/<NN>-<slug>.md`. The series matches
`[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,19}`; allocate the next zero-padded number as max+1 without
reusing gaps. `depends_on` is the authoritative execution prerequisite.

The Planning Coordinator is the only durable plan writer. The Engineering Review
Board is read-only. Material revisions increment `revision`, reset review and
approval fields, and require another review. Explicit human approval requires a
matching ERB `ready` record for the exact plan path, ID, revision, and baseline;
persist every ERB record through `/record-plan-review` before revision or
approval. Approval metadata updates do not increment revision. Execute only
lifecycle-valid approved plans with completed dependencies, matching approval,
and unchanged or re-reviewed baseline. Keep live OpenCode configuration
machine-local.
