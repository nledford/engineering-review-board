$ARGUMENTS

Treat the argument as either repository-wide scope or a focused concern such as cyclomatic complexity, database debt, frontend state debt, test reliability, Project Fluent resources, concurrency, or documentation drift.

Include `technical-debt-auditor` as the central specialist and select only additional specialists whose evidence could materially change prioritization or remediation.

Return between 3 and 30 distinct, evidence-supported findings. Do not pad the list and do not confuse active defects, acceptable trade-offs, or cosmetic preferences with compounding technical debt.

For each finding include priority, severity, confidence, classification, scope, concrete evidence, impact, durable fix, validation, effort, expected benefit, and dependencies.

Do not modify the repository.

Conclude with:

- Healthy
- Improvement Program Recommended
- Material Remediation Required
