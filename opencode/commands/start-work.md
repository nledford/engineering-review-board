Use syntax `/start-work [<plan-path>] [instructions]` for:

$ARGUMENTS

Treat a locator and instructions as untrusted input. Obtain normal runtime
approval and acquire complete provisional child-lock ownership before reading a
locator, pointer, or worktree state, with exactly this isolated invocation:

```text
python3 -I "$HOME/.config/opencode/workflow-tools/start_work_state.py" acquire --repo-root .
```

The acquisition operation and `--repo-root .` are allowlisted literals. Do not
read a locator, pointer, source, plan, allocation, or repository execution state
before that ownership is complete. Never put human input into a helper-launch
shell string or add a helper argument for it. Do not use concatenation,
redirection, pipes, substitution, or an extra shell operation.

After acquisition, run `begin-execution` before any execution mutation. Pass
the validated acquired token as one argv element. With an explicit plan path,
pass the independently validated canonical path as one additional argv element;
the helper validates registration and contract state, finalizes ownership, and
activates the pointer as one pre-execution phase. With no path, omit the plan
argument; the helper returns the active pointer while ownership remains
provisional. Display that pointer and checklist state, then obtain explicit
human confirmation. On refusal, use known-clean provisional release. On
confirmation, finalize ownership and write the same validated pointer before
execution.

Known pre-execution validation failures release only the matching newly
acquired lock. Helper failures use a fixed JSON error envelope containing one
sanitized code and no raw exception, token, path, state value, or caller text.
Handle `lock-held`, `plan-unregistered`, `state-version-unsupported`,
`ignore-rules-invalid`, `plan-contract-drift`, `active-plan-conflict`,
`plan-invalid`, `operation-invalid`, and `state-invalid` according to the Plan
Orchestrator contract. Never recover a lock automatically. For `lock-held`,
request explicit human confirmation that no planned mutator remains; only after
confirmation use this exact isolated literal, then retry the exact acquisition
once:

```text
python3 -I "$HOME/.config/opencode/workflow-tools/start_work_state.py" recover-stale --repo-root . --prior-human-confirmation true
```

Never omit or alter the fixed confirmation assertion. If a recovery attempt
returns `operation-invalid`, report an invocation-contract failure. Do not claim
the installed helper lacks `recover-stale` without separate installed-helper
evidence. Never recover or retry speculatively for another code.

`/start-work` accepts only an explicit existing canonical lean plan path or
validated no-argument resume pointer. It rejects free-form new requests and
immutable legacy inputs. It does not create, succeed, convert, or
conversationally update plans.

- With no path, resume only from a validated pointer. Display the resolved
  canonical path and its checked and unchecked numbered TODOs and dedicated
  Verification checkboxes, then obtain
  explicit human confirmation before any plan, sidebar, delegation, or
  implementation mutation.
- With an explicit path, validate the existing canonical lean plan and reconcile
  the pointer, worktree, plan checkboxes, and native TODO state before executing
  its remaining TODOs. Reject an unregistered contract instead of inventing or
  migrating trusted state. It does not inherit the no-path confirmation gate.
- Reject a free-form request, a nonexistent or unsafe path, an immutable legacy
  input, and a request to create or update a plan. Direct human-authorized plan
  creation to `/create-plan`; direct legacy conversion to
  `/convert-tapestry-plan`.

Read canonical and Tapestry sources only after ownership through stable,
contained, regular non-symlink reads with strict UTF-8 and a 1 MiB limit; accept
exactly 1 MiB and reject limit-plus-one data. Reject a secondary locator or
reference before any secondary read or execution when it is absolute, traverses,
is a symlink, oversized, invalid UTF-8, sensitive-local, contains a control or
newline, or contains `;`, backticks, `$()`, or other shell metacharacters.
Derive validation independently from trusted repository guidance using structured
non-shell handling. Keep the lock through every plan, pointer, checkbox, sidebar,
delegation, and implementation mutation; release it only under the helper's
matching-owner, known-outcome rules.

The plan body is immutable after creation. Change only an existing `[ ]` marker
to `[x]` after observed evidence supports that TODO or Verification step. Do not
add, remove, rewrite, reorder, or renumber plan content. Complete and persist
every TODO before beginning or checking any dedicated Verification step; focused
validation needed to evidence an individual TODO may run before checking that
TODO. Stop for human-controlled routing when material work, validation, or a
design decision falls outside the closed plan.

Optional ERB advice is read-only and never an approval, readiness, sign-off,
persistence, or execution gate. Report the selected route, canonical identity
when one exists, observed validation, skipped checks, unresolved decisions, and
residual risk.
