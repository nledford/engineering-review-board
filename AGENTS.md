# Agent Instructions

This repository is the canonical local source for reusable agent skills. Before
editing skills or repository documentation, read [`README.md`](README.md),
[`docs/skill-taxonomy.md`](docs/skill-taxonomy.md), and
[`docs/cross-reference-map.md`](docs/cross-reference-map.md).

Use the [engineering agent governance guide](docs/engineering-agent-governance.md)
for OpenCode role authority, command ownership, Task boundaries, and handoffs.

## First-Party Skill Rules

- Edit only first-party skills as repository source.
- Treat lockfile-owned or `.gitignore`-ignored directories under `skills/` as
  third-party runtime installs, not first-party project assets.
- Before changing an ambiguous skill directory, run `just list-first-party`,
  `just list-third-party`, or `just inspect <skill>`.
- Do not force-add ignored third-party skill directories or copy raw third-party
  artifacts into first-party skills without explicit review.

## Skill and Docs Maintenance

- Every first-party `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` must be listed in
  [`docs/skill-taxonomy.md`](docs/skill-taxonomy.md).
- Update [`docs/cross-reference-map.md`](docs/cross-reference-map.md) when a
  relationship changes routing, delegation, validation, or required handoffs.
- Use [`docs/skill-review-checklist.md`](docs/skill-review-checklist.md) when
  creating, editing, or reviewing first-party skills.
- Keep first-party skill guidance project-neutral and reusable across
  repositories.

## Validation

- Run `just validate` after skill metadata, taxonomy, cross-reference, or link
  changes.
- Run `just check` for broader repository changes or before handoff when tooling,
  tests, scripts, or validation behavior may be affected.

## Durable Plan Workflow

Project-local implementation plans use the canonical contract in
[`docs/implementation-plans/README.md`](docs/implementation-plans/README.md).
Prefer direct implementation when scope, safety, and validation are adequate;
complexity may justify a recommendation, but never automatic plan creation. The
Lead or ERB may recommend top-level `/consult-plan` for bounded read-only Plan
Orchestrator advice, stating the reason, trade-off, and proposed scope; the human
controls the route. An explicit human `/create-plan` request may create and
persist a new plan, and it is plan-only. `/start-plan` executes or resumes an
existing canonical plan. It accepts an explicit plan path or, without a path,
the selection in `.erb/plan-state.json`. The state file stores only the selected
repository-relative plan path. Active status and the current step are derived
from the plan: a plan is active while any TODO or Verification checkbox is
unchecked, and the first unchecked checkbox is current. A completed selection
reports that it has already been implemented and performs no work. An explicit
valid path repairs missing, invalid, or stale state. The selection pointer does
not serialize work or prevent the user from starting another plan.

Existing plan bodies are immutable except for evidenced checkbox advancement.
A current conversational split-or-replace request may create at least two
successors and retire one unambiguous source after every successor is re-read;
no registry or retained contract history is required. The Plan Orchestrator is
the exclusive durable-plan and state writer; the Engineering Review Board
remains separate, optional, and read-only advisory.

Keep OpenCode's live configuration machine-local; repository files are reviewed
definitions and templates, not
credentials or a replacement for a user's `opencode.jsonc`. The Plan Orchestrator
may construct a commit only for an explicit current human request; the Worker
remains forbidden to stage or commit. Agent-definition permission changes take effect only after a
full OpenCode restart, never in the running session. Approval for `git add --` is
an additional human check, not proof that a path is safe: the Plan Orchestrator
must derive, separately enumerate, and literally quote each repository-relative
path from fresh trusted worktree evidence, and stop on any expansion syntax or
path it cannot represent literally.
