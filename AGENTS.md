# Agent Instructions

This repository is the canonical local source for reusable agent skills. Before
editing skills or repository documentation, read [`README.md`](README.md),
[`docs/skill-taxonomy.md`](docs/skill-taxonomy.md), and
[`docs/cross-reference-map.md`](docs/cross-reference-map.md).

Use the [engineering agent governance guide](docs/engineering-agent-governance.md)
for OpenCode role authority, command ownership, Task boundaries, and handoffs.

## First-Party Skill Rules

- Edit only first-party skills as repository source.
- Treat lockfile-owned or `.gitignore`-ignored directories under `skills/` as
  third-party runtime installs, not first-party project assets.
- Before changing an ambiguous skill directory, run `just list-first-party`,
  `just list-third-party`, or `just inspect <skill>`.
- Do not force-add ignored third-party skill directories or copy raw third-party
  artifacts into first-party skills without explicit review.

## Skill and Docs Maintenance

- Every first-party `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` must be listed in
  [`docs/skill-taxonomy.md`](docs/skill-taxonomy.md).
- Update [`docs/cross-reference-map.md`](docs/cross-reference-map.md) when a
  relationship changes routing, delegation, validation, or required handoffs.
- Use [`docs/skill-review-checklist.md`](docs/skill-review-checklist.md) when
  creating, editing, or reviewing first-party skills.
- Keep first-party skill guidance project-neutral and reusable across
  repositories.

## Validation

- Run `just validate` after skill metadata, taxonomy, cross-reference, or link
  changes.
- Run `just check` for broader repository changes or before handoff when tooling,
  tests, scripts, or validation behavior may be affected.

## Durable Plan Workflow

Project-local implementation plans use the canonical contract in
[`docs/implementation-plans/README.md`](docs/implementation-plans/README.md).
Prefer direct implementation when scope, safety, and validation are adequate;
complexity may justify a recommendation, but never automatic plan creation. The
Lead or ERB may recommend top-level `/consult-plan` for bounded read-only Plan
Orchestrator advice, stating the reason, trade-off, and proposed scope; the human
controls the route. An explicit human `/create-plan` request may create and
persist a new plan, and it is plan-only. An explicit
`/update-plan <exact-plan-path>` request may update one active plan in place and
is also plan-only; it never infers the target from state or changes state.
`/start-plan` executes or resumes an existing canonical plan. It accepts an
explicit plan path or, without a path, the selection in `.erb/plan-state.json`.
The state file stores only the selected repository-relative plan path. Active
status and the current step are derived from the plan: a plan is active while
any TODO or Verification checkbox is unchecked, and the first unchecked
checkbox is current. A completed selection reports that it has already been
implemented and performs no work. An explicit valid path repairs missing,
invalid, or stale state. The selection pointer does not serialize work or
prevent the user from starting another plan.

Active plan bodies are immutable by default and during execution except for
evidenced checkbox advancement. A current explicit `/update-plan` request may
apply the smallest exact-content update to one active plan; completed plans
remain immutable, new work stays unchecked, and changed or invalidated checked
items reset to unchecked.
Every TODO and Verification entry follows the canonical atomic-purpose,
permission-disclosure, prerequisite-ordering, and finite-progress contract.
`/update-plan` may re-sequence the smallest affected set when dependency
correctness requires it; planning-time permission disclosure never grants
runtime approval.

During `/start-plan`, every Worker assignment has exactly one mode:
`implementation` or non-editing `verification`. Implementation keeps one
bounded slice, its obligation partition, evidence reconciliation, and finite
in-scope correction. Verification may use packet-authorized local setup, one
diagnostic pass, finite lock or process waiting, and exact owned disposable
cleanup within a parent-supplied budget of at most three starts. The Plan
Orchestrator alone classifies planned effects and decides retry, correction,
uncertain-result, and checkbox transitions; Worker results are evidence rather
than checkbox authority and never a competing transition decision.

In a human-owned repository, allowed checked-in Just recipes, package scripts,
build scripts, tests, hooks, and binaries execute as trusted arbitrary local
code with the host authority of the OpenCode process. Unknown direct command
forms and consequential directly invoked operations remain ask/deny-gated.
Static permission rules classify direct command forms; they do not sandbox
transitive runner effects or provide task-scoped filesystem or network
containment.
External-repository runners are not trusted by this posture; genuinely untrusted
execution needs an outer container, VM, or OS control.

After the required full restart, the Lead and Worker trusted-local profiles allow
routine scoped in-repository edits and their canonical local quality, build, and
test command families without runtime approval. Plan and state paths retain their
existing boundaries.

A current conversational split-or-replace request may create at least two
successors and retire one unambiguous source after every successor is re-read;
no registry or retained contract history is required. The Plan Orchestrator is
the exclusive durable-plan and state writer; the Engineering Review Board
remains separate, optional, and read-only advisory. After the Plan Orchestrator
creates and validates a plan, an explicit current human commit request may
authorize the Engineering Lead to stage and commit that canonical plan Markdown.
This exception does not authorize plan edits or execution and never includes
`.erb/plan-state.json`.

Keep OpenCode's live configuration machine-local; repository files are reviewed
definitions and templates, not
credentials or a replacement for a user's `opencode.jsonc`. The Plan Orchestrator
may construct a commit only for an explicit current human request; the Worker
remains forbidden to stage or commit. Agent-definition permission changes take
effect only after a full OpenCode restart, never in the running session.
Native checked-in agent and command definitions plus the Plan Orchestrator remain
authoritative. No plugin or secondary runtime may own, inject, or replace agents
or commands; mutate plans or state; classify permissions, effects, or retries; or
autonomously continue work. Reconsider plugins only for observational status or
UX assistance after full-restart measurements show residual friction; observation
never grants workflow authority.
Approval for `git add --` is an additional human check, not proof that a path is
safe: the Plan Orchestrator and the Lead's canonical-plan staging exception must
derive, separately enumerate, and literally quote each repository-relative path
from fresh trusted worktree evidence, and stop on any expansion syntax or path
they cannot represent literally.
