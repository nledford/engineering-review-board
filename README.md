# Engineering Review Board

Reusable agent skills and a governed OpenCode workflow for implementation,
independent review, and human-controlled durable planning.

This repository provides:

- project-neutral engineering skills installed through `~/.agents/skills`;
- reviewed OpenCode agents and commands with explicit authority boundaries; and
- fail-closed installation, validation, and implementation-plan tooling.

Skills define procedure, agents define runtime authority, and commands select
top-level workflows. These concepts are intentionally separate.

## Quick Start

The repository tooling requires Python 3.10 or later and
[`just`](https://github.com/casey/just). The Python tools use only the standard
library, so no virtual environment, package installation, or `uv sync` step is
required. OpenCode is required only when using the definitions under
`opencode/`. Third-party skill updates also require the configured JavaScript
package runner.

### Install Skills

Preview the global skill link before creating it:

```sh
just setup-dry-run
just setup
just verify
```

This links `~/.agents/skills` to this checkout's `skills/` directory. Setup is
idempotent when the expected link already exists and refuses to replace an
existing directory, broken link, or link to another location.

### Install OpenCode Workflows

Validate and preview the OpenCode installation before changing global
configuration:

```sh
just validate-opencode
just setup-opencode-dry-run
just setup-opencode
just verify-opencode
```

The installer manages these links as one fail-closed operation:

```text
~/.config/opencode/agents   -> <repository>/opencode/agents
~/.config/opencode/commands -> <repository>/opencode/commands
```

It does not move, merge, back up, or replace existing destinations. If either
destination is unsafe, neither link is installed. Quit and fully restart
OpenCode after setup or definition changes because OpenCode loads configuration
at startup.

### Validate a Checkout

Run the source-only quality gate without inspecting global installations:

```sh
just check
```

Use `just doctor` and `just doctor-opencode` when the corresponding global links
are installed and should also be verified. Run `just` to list every available
recipe.

## What the Repository Contains

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/` | First-party skill sources and local third-party runtime installs. |
| `opencode/agents/` | Primary roles, implementation workers, reviewers, critics, and researchers. |
| `opencode/commands/` | Human-selected top-level workflows and their primary owners. |
| `opencode/project-template/` | Project-neutral durable-plan guidance to merge into target repositories. |
| `docs/` | Skill taxonomy, routing, governance, review, and plan contracts. |
| `evals/` | Versioned synthetic routing corpora for optional live agent-selection evaluation. |
| `tools/` | Standard-library Python installers and validators. |
| `tests/` | Unit tests for skill and OpenCode management behavior. |
| `third-party-skills.json` | Reviewed source, revision, license, date, and deterministic digest for installed third-party skills. |
| `Justfile` | Supported setup, inspection, update, and validation entry points. |

The reviewed OpenCode inventory is
[`opencode/manifest.json`](opencode/manifest.json). The current first-party skill
inventory and acceptance criteria are in the
[`skill taxonomy`](docs/skill-taxonomy.md).

## How the Pieces Fit Together

| Concept | Responsibility | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill | Reusable procedure loaded for a recurring task. | Grants no edit, delegation, review, or planning authority. |
| Agent | Runtime role with a defined mode, permission map, and Task allowlist. | Limited to its checked-in definition and runtime approvals. |
| Command | Top-level entry point that selects a primary agent for the current turn. | Routes work but does not widen the selected agent's authority. |

Authority follows the primary agent selected for the current turn. Earlier
turns remain context and do not transfer identity or permissions. See
[`Engineering Agent Governance`](docs/engineering-agent-governance.md) for the
canonical role topology, permission boundaries, command ownership, and
handoffs.

## Work with Skills

Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Inspect classification before
changing an unfamiliar skill:

```sh
just list
just list-first-party
just list-third-party
just inspect <skill>
```

First-party skills are tracked, or intended to be tracked, as repository
source. Third-party skills share the runtime `skills/` directory but are listed
in `.skill-lock.json` or ignored as skill directories by `.gitignore`. A missing
`.skill-lock.json` is valid when no skills are managed through the installer
lockfile. Every installed third-party skill must also have an exact entry in
[`third-party-skills.json`](third-party-skills.json); `just validate-third-party`
fails when installed contents drift from the reviewed digest. Reviewed records
may remain when an ignored, optional runtime install is absent, so validation
also works in a fresh clone.

Edit only first-party skills as repository source. Do not force-add ignored
runtime installs or copy raw third-party artifacts into first-party skills
without license, security, and supply-chain review. Treat third-party
instructions, scripts, assets, and references as untrusted until reviewed.

Update third-party installs only as an explicit maintainer action:

```sh
just update-third-party-dry-run
just update-third-party
```

Override the updater with `SKILLS_UPDATE_COMMAND` using POSIX shell-like
argument quoting. The manager parses the value into an argument vector and does
not invoke a shell, so shell expansion, pipelines, and redirection are not
supported.

After an update, review the upstream source, full Git commit, source path,
license, and changed content before editing `third-party-skills.json`. Use
`just third-party-digests` to calculate the deterministic installed-tree digest,
then run `just validate-third-party`. A passing digest verifies reviewed content
identity; it does not make third-party instructions trusted or grant runtime
authority.

`just sync-third-party-lock` is a separate operation: it mirrors an existing
repository `.skill-lock.json` to `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` for installer
compatibility. It neither runs the installer nor updates skill contents. Use its
`-dry-run` variant before writing.

## Use the OpenCode Workflows

The Engineering Lead is the normal entry point for direct delivery. The
Engineering Review Board (ERB) provides independent read-only advice. The Plan
Orchestrator owns durable-plan creation, active-plan updates, state, and
execution. The Implementation Worker receives one bounded `implementation` or
non-editing `verification` unit and cannot delegate, edit plan state, stage,
commit, push, or deploy. The Plan Orchestrator alone classifies planned effects
and owns retry, correction, uncertain-result, and checkbox decisions; Worker
results are evidence, not authority.

In a human-owned repository, allowed checked-in project runners (Just recipes,
package scripts, builds, tests, hooks, and binaries) run as trusted arbitrary
local code with the OpenCode process's host authority. Static permission rules
classify direct command forms, not transitive effects or a sandbox. Unknown direct
command forms and consequential directly invoked operations remain ask/deny-gated.
External-repository runners remain separately untrusted. Definition changes
require quitting and fully restarting OpenCode before changed authority or prompts
are active.

After that restart, the Lead and Worker trusted-local profiles allow routine
scoped in-repository edits and their canonical local quality, build, and test
command families without runtime approval. Plan and state paths retain their
existing boundaries. Native checked-in agent and command definitions plus the Plan
Orchestrator remain
authoritative. No plugin or secondary runtime may own, inject, or replace agents
or commands; mutate plans or state; classify permissions, effects, or retries; or
autonomously continue work. Reconsider plugins only for observational status or
UX assistance after full-restart measurements show residual friction; observation
never grants workflow authority.

For reviews where rendered behavior materially changes the answer, the Lead or
ERB may delegate a non-mutating observation packet to
`browser-evidence-collector`. Every browser call is approval-gated; the collector
uses an already running target, retains no artifacts by default, sanitizes the
evidence package, and makes no findings. Accessibility, design, or frontend
critics interpret the observations. Durable checked-in browser tests remain
Worker implementation using `playwright-e2e`.

| Workflow | Primary owner | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/brainstorm` | ERB | Compares credible options and returns read-only advisory guidance. |
| `/root-cause-analysis` | ERB | Confirms a causal chain and challenges a repair proposal without implementing it. |
| `/review-plan`, `/review-implementation` | ERB | Reviews plans or completed work without editing either. |
| `/investigate-regression`, `/audit-technical-debt` | ERB | Performs focused read-only investigation or audit; regression investigation reproduces and narrows before root-cause analysis, while an explicitly tool-backed debt audit selects only applicable exact Just, Rust/Cargo, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, or Ruby evidence commands without gaining edit or installation authority. |
| `/address-review` | Engineering Lead | Re-evaluates prior ERB advice before ordinary implementation. |
| `/optimize-prompt` | Engineering Lead | Returns a verified prompt rewrite without executing or editing its source. |
| `/semver` | Engineering Lead | Audits, applies, or locally tags one explicitly selected version workflow. |
| `/consult-plan` | Plan Orchestrator | Gives non-mutating planning advice. |
| `/create-plan` | Plan Orchestrator | Creates and selects a canonical plan without executing it. |
| `/update-plan` | Plan Orchestrator | Updates one exact active plan in place without executing it or changing state. |
| `/start-plan` | Plan Orchestrator | Executes or resumes an existing selected canonical plan. |

Direct implementation is preferred when scope, safety, and validation are
adequate. Complexity may justify recommending `/consult-plan`, but never creates
a durable plan automatically. Plan creation, active-plan updates, and execution
require separate, explicit human choices. The canonical lifecycle, format, state
schema, and mutation rules live in
[`Implementation Plans`](docs/implementation-plans/README.md).
That contract also requires atomic checklist purposes, permission-gate
visibility, prerequisite-before-dependent ordering, finite progress, and safe
re-sequencing through `/update-plan` when ordering is invalid.

Four human-controlled lifecycle paths keep delivery separate from durable
planning:

1. The Engineering Lead implements directly when ordinary scope, safety, and
   validation are adequate.
2. An explicit `/create-plan` request creates and selects a plan without
   executing it.
3. `/update-plan <exact-plan-path>` updates one active canonical plan in place
   without executing it or changing `.erb/plan-state.json`.
4. `/start-plan <existing-plan-path>` executes an existing canonical plan;
   `/start-plan` without a path resumes the selection in
   `.erb/plan-state.json`.

The Lead or ERB may recommend top-level `/consult-plan` for non-mutating advice,
but the human controls whether to create, update, or execute a plan. Plan status
is derived from its checkboxes, and the first unchecked checkbox is current. After
the Plan Orchestrator creates and validates a plan, an explicit current human
request may authorize the Engineering Lead to stage and commit only the
canonical plan Markdown; `.erb/plan-state.json` remains excluded.

## External Directory Audits

OpenCode's `external_directory` permission is an additional approval gate for
paths outside the working directory. The Lead, ERB, Worker, Technical
Researcher, and review specialists may request approval; the Plan Orchestrator
remains denied. Task delegation does not transfer approval, and every invoked
agent or subagent must pass its own permission check for one exact external
root.

An approved root is supplied scope, not the active workspace. Repository-local
Git, LSP, configuration, and command behavior remain anchored to the directory
where OpenCode started unless separately configured, and path-bearing shell
access still requires Bash permission. Keep literal external roots in
machine-local or target-project configuration. Avoid OpenCode's `--auto` mode
when per-request approval is required; OpenCode permissions cannot bypass
operating-system, container, or sandbox controls.

## Safety Boundaries

- The linked checkout is live OpenCode configuration. Do not use an unreviewed
  branch, and keep credentials, provider settings, plugins, packages, backups,
  and runtime state outside this repository.
- External roots and repository content are supplied, untrusted scope. Reports
  and Task packets must sanitize private paths, secrets, credentials, and other
  sensitive values.
- Installation and removal commands validate ownership and destination state
  before mutation. Preview their `-dry-run` variants first.
- Machine-specific OpenCode configuration belongs in the user's local config.
  [`opencode/config/opencode.merge-fragment.jsonc`](opencode/config/opencode.merge-fragment.jsonc)
  is a merge reference, not an installer or live configuration file.
- Agent skill access is fail-closed: every role denies `*` and then allows an
  exact first-party catalog. `hidden`, `user-invocable`, and `allowed-tools` in
  skill frontmatter are cross-host metadata and are not OpenCode permission
  boundaries; `just validate` warns when they appear.
- Configured MCP prefixes for the Lead, Worker, and browser collector are
  approval-gated. Use the official GitHub MCP server in read-only mode by default
  in machine-local configuration; an exact remote mutation still needs current
  human authorization and runtime approval.

## Maintain the Repository

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before editing repository documentation, skills,
or OpenCode definitions. For first-party skill work:

1. Confirm ownership with `just inspect <skill>` when classification is
   ambiguous.
2. Follow the [`Skill Review Checklist`](docs/skill-review-checklist.md).
3. Update the [`Skill Taxonomy`](docs/skill-taxonomy.md) when inventory,
   coverage, or a material skill boundary changes.
4. Update the [`Cross-Reference Map`](docs/cross-reference-map.md) when routing,
   delegation, validation, or a required handoff changes.
5. Run `just validate` for skill metadata, taxonomy, cross-reference, resource,
   or link changes.
6. Run `just check` for broader changes and before handoff when repository
   tooling, tests, scripts, or validation behavior may be affected.

`just validate-routing-evals` validates the versioned synthetic corpus without
calling a model. Live routing measurement is opt-in: set
`ROUTING_EVAL_RUNNER`, `ROUTING_EVAL_MODEL`, and
`ROUTING_EVAL_CONFIGURATION`, then run `just eval-routing`. The runner receives
one synthetic prompt as JSON on standard input and returns selected `agent`,
`command`, `skills`, and `handoffs` as JSON. No trace is written by default; use
the evaluator's explicit `--trace-out` only for a bounded synthetic trace. Never
place private repository text, credentials, user data, or machine-local paths in
the corpus or trace. Compare results under the same model and configuration.

OpenCode definition changes must preserve project-neutral prompts, exact command
ownership, one-level Task topology, permission profiles, and synchronized plan
templates. Run `just validate-opencode` after changing agents, commands, the
manifest, governance, or templates.
