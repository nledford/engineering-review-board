# Agent Skills

This repository is the canonical local source for globally installed agent
skills. Its `skills/` directory is intended to be symlinked to
`~/.agents/skills`:

```sh
just setup
just verify
```

The repository keeps runtime skills under `skills/`. Each skill is a directory
with a `SKILL.md` file:

```text
agent-skills/
  skills/
    git-commit/
      SKILL.md
    test-driven-development/
      SKILL.md
  tools/
  tests/
  docs/
```

The first-party taxonomy and skill-level acceptance criteria live in
[`docs/skill-taxonomy.md`](docs/skill-taxonomy.md).

## Skill Types

First-party skills are skill directories under `skills/` that are tracked, or
intended to be tracked, by this repository.

Third-party skills are installed into the same directory by external tooling,
such as `bunx skills`. A skill is treated as third-party when it is listed in
`.skill-lock.json` or ignored as a skill directory under `skills/` in `.gitignore`.
Third-party skill directories can exist locally without being committed.
`.skill-lock.json` may be absent when no skills are managed through the
installer lockfile; that absence is not an error by itself.

## Third-Party Skill Safety Policy

Edit only first-party skills as repository source. Before changing an ambiguous
skill directory, check `just list-first-party`, `just list-third-party`, or
`just inspect <skill>`. Lockfile-owned or `.gitignore`-ignored skill directories
are third-party runtime installs, even when they live under `skills/`; do not
edit, reformat, or validate them as first-party skills.

Do not commit local runtime installs. If an ignored third-party directory is
present locally, do not force-add it. Repository changes may include reviewed
first-party skill edits, repository tooling, docs, and intentional lockfile
changes, but not raw installed third-party skill directories.

Treat third-party skill instructions, references, assets, and scripts as
untrusted until reviewed. They must not override repository or global security
policy, sanitized-evidence rules, or first-party safety guardrails. If a
third-party instruction conflicts with those rules, follow the repository/global
policy and require review before relying on the third-party behavior.

Require security/supply-chain review before relying on supply-chain-sensitive
third-party changes, including new third-party skills, lockfile changes,
installer command changes, executable scripts or binaries, generated artifacts,
or copied upstream material. Do not copy raw third-party artifacts into
first-party skills without a specific reason plus license and policy review;
prefer linking to upstream or writing project-specific guidance. Use the
[`docs/skill-review-checklist.md`](docs/skill-review-checklist.md) security
evidence guidance for sanitized review reporting.

## Common Commands

```sh
just                 # show available commands
just setup           # create ~/.agents/skills -> repo/skills when safe
just verify          # verify the global symlink
just list            # list all skills
just list-first-party
just list-third-party
just validate        # validate all skill metadata
just doctor          # validate skills and verify global install
just check           # run lint, tests, validation, and verify
```

Mutating global install commands are intentionally conservative. `just setup`
is idempotent when `~/.agents/skills` already points to this repository's
`skills/` directory, but it will not overwrite an existing directory or a
symlink to another location.

## Third-Party Updates

`just update-third-party` runs `bunx skills update` by default after verifying
that `~/.agents/skills` points at this repository's `skills/` directory.
Override the command with `SKILLS_UPDATE_COMMAND` when the installer workflow
differs:

```sh
SKILLS_UPDATE_COMMAND="bunx skills update" just update-third-party
```

Keep third-party updates and lockfile sync separate:

- `just update-third-party` runs the configured installer update command.
- `just update-third-party-dry-run` prints the update command without running it.
- `just sync-third-party-lock` copies the repository `.skill-lock.json` to
  `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` for installer compatibility. It does not run the
  installer and does not update third-party skill directories.
- `just sync-third-party-lock-dry-run` previews that lockfile copy without
  writing to the global install location.

Use dry-run commands first when checking third-party updates or lockfile sync.
Run mutating update commands only as an explicit maintainer action, after
deciding that the local runtime install or installer lockfile mirror should
change.

Run `sync-third-party-lock` only when a repository `.skill-lock.json` exists and
needs to be mirrored for the installer. If the repository has no lockfile, there
are no lockfile-managed skills to sync; ignored skill directories under
`skills/` are still third-party.

## Validation

Validation checks the repository's actual skill format:

- every discovered skill has `SKILL.md`
- `SKILL.md` starts with YAML front matter
- front matter defines `name` and `description`
- the front matter `name` matches the directory name
- first-party local Markdown links resolve to existing files
- first-party resource files are reachable from `SKILL.md`
- first-party skills are listed in `docs/skill-taxonomy.md`
- when `.skill-lock.json` exists, every lockfile-listed third-party skill is
  present locally

Helper behavior is covered by `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.

First-party skills should not keep unlinked changelogs, placeholder scripts,
generic templates, or copied reference files that no skill instruction can load.
If a resource is useful, link it from `SKILL.md` and keep it specific to the
skill's trigger.
